    "Seismic data is collected using reflection seismology, or seismic reflection. The method requires a controlled seismic source of energy, such as compressed air or a seismic vibrator, and sensors record the reflection from rock interfaces within the subsurface. The recorded data is then processed to create a 3D view of earth’s interior. Reflection seismology is similar to X-ray, sonar and echolocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A seismic image is produced from imaging the reflection coming from rock boundaries. The seismic image shows the boundaries between different rock types. In theory, the strength of reflection is directly proportional to the difference in the physical properties on either sides of the interface. While seismic images show rock boundaries, they don't say much about the rock themselves; some rocks are easy to identify while some are difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several areas of the world where there are vast quantities of salt in the subsurface. One of the challenges of seismic imaging is to identify the part of subsurface which is salt. Salt has characteristics that makes it both simple and hard to identify. Salt density is usually 2.14 g/cc which is lower than most surrounding rocks. The seismic velocity of salt is 4.5 km/sec, which is usually faster than its surrounding rocks. This difference creates a sharp reflection at the salt-sediment interface. Usually salt is an amorphous rock without much internal structure. This means that there is typically not much reflectivity inside the salt, unless there are sediments trapped inside it. The unusually high seismic velocity of salt can create problems with seismic imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The data is a set of images chosen at various locations chosen at random in the subsurface. The images are 101 x 101 pixels and each pixel is classified as either salt or sediment. In addition to the seismic images, the depth of the imaged location is provided for each image. The goal of the competition is to segment regions that contain salt.\n",

And so\\nin the Middle Ages men supposed this to be the sepulchre of Remus, who\\nwas slain by his own brother at the founding of the city, so ancient and\\nmysterious it appears; but we have now, perhaps unfortunately, more\\naccurate information about it, and know that it is the tomb of one Caius\\nCestius, a Roman gentleman of small note, who died about 30 B.C.\\n\\nYet though we cannot care much for the dead man who lies in lonely state\\nbeneath it, and who is only known to the world through his sepulchre,\\nstill this pyramid will be ever dear to the eyes of all English-speaking\\npeople, because at evening its shadows fall on the tomb of one who walks\\nwith Spenser, and Shakespeare, and Byron, and Shelley, and Elizabeth\\nBarrett Browning in the great procession of the sweet singers of England.\\n\\nFor at its foot there is a green sunny slope, known as the Old Protestant\\nCemetery, and on this a common-looking grave, which bears the following\\ninscription:\\n\\n    This grave contains all that was mortal of a young English poet, who\\n    on his deathbed, in the bitterness of his heart, desired these words\\n    to be engraven on his tombstone: HERE LIES ONE WHOSE NAME WAS WRIT IN\\n    WATER.  February 24, 1821.\\n\\nAnd the name of the young English poet is John Keats.\\n\\nLord Houghton calls this cemetery ‘one of the most beautiful spots on\\nwhich the eye and heart of man can rest,’ and Shelley speaks of it as\\nmaking one ‘in love with death, to think that one should be buried in so\\nsweet a place’; and indeed when I saw the violets and the daisies and the\\npoppies that overgrow the tomb, I remembered how the dead poet had once\\ntold his friend that he thought the ‘intensest pleasure he had received\\nin life was in watching the growth of flowers,’ and how another time,\\nafter lying a while quite still, he murmured in some strange prescience\\nof early death, ‘I feel the flowers growing over me.’\\n\\nBut this time-worn stone and these wildflowers are but poor memorials {2}\\nof one so great as Keats; most of all, too, in this city of Rome, which\\npays such honour to her dead; where popes, and emperors, and saints, and\\ncardinals lie hidden in ‘porphyry wombs,’ or couched in baths of jasper\\nand chalcedony and malachite, ablaze with precious stones and metals, and\\ntended with continual service.  For very noble is the site, and worthy of\\na noble monument; behind looms the grey pyramid, symbol of the world’s\\nage, and filled with memories of the sphinx, and the lotus leaf, and the\\nglories of old Nile; in front is the Monte Testaccio, built, it is said,\\nwith the broken fragments of the vessels in which all the nations of the\\nEast and the West brought their tribute to Rome; and a little distance\\noff, along the slope of the hill under the Aurelian wall, some tall gaunt\\ncypresses rise, like burnt-out funeral torches, to mark the spot where\\nShelley’s heart (that ‘heart of hearts’!) lies in the earth; and, above\\nall, the soil on which we tread is very Rome!\\n\\nAs I stood beside the mean grave of this divine boy, I thought of him as\\nof a Priest of Beauty slain before his time; and the vision of Guido’s\\nSt. Sebastian came before my eyes as I saw him at Genoa, a lovely brown\\nboy, with crisp, clustering hair and red lips, bound by his evil enemies\\nto a tree, and though pierced by arrows, raising his eyes with divine,\\nimpassioned gaze towards the Eternal Beauty of the opening heavens.  And\\nthus my thoughts shaped themselves to rhyme:\\n\\n                              HEU MISERANDE PUER\\n\\n    Rid of the world’s injustice and its pain,\\n       He rests at last beneath God’s veil of blue;\\n       Taken from life while life and love were new\\n    The youngest of the martyrs here is lain,\\n    Fair as Sebastian and as foully slain.\\n       No cypress shades his grave, nor funeral yew,\\n       But red-lipped daisies, violets drenched with dew,\\n    And sleepy poppies, catch the evening rain.\\n\\n    O proudest heart that broke for misery!\\n       O saddest poet that the world hath seen!\\n          O sweetest singer of the English land!\\n          Thy name was writ in water on the sand,\\n       But our tears shall keep thy memory green,\\n    And make it flourish like a Basil-tree.\\n\\n    _Rome_, 1877.\\n\\n_Note_.—A later version of this sonnet, under the title of ‘The Grave of\\nKeats,’ is given in the _Poems_, page 157.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKEATS’S SONNET ON BLUE\\n(_Century Guild Hobby Horse_, July 1886.)\\n\\n\\nDuring my tour in America I happened one evening to find myself in\\nLouisville, Kentucky.  The subject I had selected to speak on was the\\nMission of Art in the Nineteenth Century, and in the course of my lecture\\nI had occasion to quote Keats’s Sonnet on Blue as an example of the\\npoet’s delicate sense of colour-harmonies.  When my lecture was concluded\\nthere came round to see me a lady of middle age, with a sweet gentle\\nmanner and a most musical voice.  She introduced herself to me as Mrs.\\nSpeed, the daughter of George Keats, and invited me to come and examine\\nthe Keats manuscripts in her possession.  I spent most of the next day\\nwith her, reading the letters of Keats to her father, some of which were\\nat that time unpublished, poring over torn yellow leaves and faded scraps\\nof paper, and wondering at the little Dante in which Keats had written\\nthose marvellous notes on Milton.  Some months afterwards, when I was in\\nCalifornia, I received a letter from Mrs. Speed asking my acceptance of\\nthe original manuscript of the sonnet which I had quoted in my lecture.\\nThis manuscript I have had reproduced here, as it seems to me to possess\\nmuch psychological interest.  It shows us the conditions that preceded\\nthe perfected form, the gradual growth, not of the conception but of the\\nexpression, and the workings of that spirit of selection which is the\\nsecret of style.  In the case of poetry, as in the case of the other\\narts, what may appear to be simply technicalities of method are in their\\nessence spiritual not mechanical, and although, in all lovely work, what\\nconcerns us is the ultimate form, not the conditions that necessitate\\nthat form, yet the preference that precedes perfection, the evolution of\\nthe beauty, and the mere making of the music, have, if not their artistic\\nvalue, at least their value to the artist.\\n\\nIt will be remembered that this sonnet was first published in 1848 by\\nLord Houghton in his _Life_, _Letters_, _and Literary Remains of John\\nKeats_.  Lord Houghton does not definitely state where he found it, but\\nit was probably among the Keats manuscripts belonging to Mr. Charles\\nBrown.  It is evidently taken from a version later than that in my\\npossession, as it accepts all the corrections, and makes three\\nvariations.  As in my manuscript the first line is torn away, I give the\\nsonnet here as it appears in Lord Houghton’s edition.\\n\\n    ANSWER TO A SONNET ENDING THUS:\\n\\n          Dark eyes are dearer far\\n    Than those that make the hyacinthine bell. {5}\\n\\n                                                        By J. H. REYNOLDS.\\n\\n    Blue!  ’Tis the life of heaven,—the domain\\n       Of Cynthia,—the wide palace of the sun,—\\n    The tent of Hesperus and all his train,—\\n       The bosomer of clouds, gold, grey and dun.\\n    Blue!  ’Tis the life of waters—ocean\\n       And all its vassal streams: pools numberless\\n    May rage, and foam, and fret, but never can\\n       Subside if not to dark-blue nativeness.\\n    Blue! gentle cousin of the forest green,\\n       Married to green in all the sweetest flowers,\\n    Forget-me-not,—the blue-bell,—and, that queen\\n       Of secrecy, the violet: what strange powers\\n    Hast thou, as a mere shadow!  But how great,\\n       When in an Eye thou art alive with fate!\\n\\n                                                              _Feb._ 1818.\\n\\nIn the _Athenæum_ of the 3rd of June 1876 appeared a letter from Mr. A.\\nJ. Horwood, stating that he had in his possession a copy of _The Garden\\nof Florence_ in which this sonnet was transcribed.  Mr. Horwood, who was\\nunaware that the sonnet had been already published by Lord Houghton,\\ngives the transcript at length.  His version reads _hue_ for _life_ in\\nthe first line, and _bright_ for _wide_ in the second, and gives the\\nsixth line thus:\\n\\n    With all his tributary streams, pools numberless,\\n\\na foot too long: it also reads _to_ for _of_ in the ninth line.  Mr.\\nBuxton Forman is of opinion that these variations are decidedly genuine,\\nbut indicative of an earlier state of the poem than that adopted in Lord\\nHoughton’s edition.  However, now that we have before us Keats’s first\\ndraft of his sonnet, it is difficult to believe that the sixth line in\\nMr. Horwood’s version is really a genuine variation.  Keats may have\\nwritten,\\n\\n                Ocean\\n    His tributary streams, pools numberless,\\n\\nand the transcript may have been carelessly made, but having got his line\\nright in his first draft, Keats probably did not spoil it in his second.\\nThe _Athenæum_ version inserts a comma after _art_ in the last line,\\nwhich seems to me a decided improvement, and eminently characteristic of\\nKeats’s method.  I am glad to see that Mr. Buxton Forman has adopted it.\\n\\nAs for the corrections that Lord Houghton’s version shows Keats to have\\nmade in the eighth and ninth lines of this sonnet, it is evident that\\nthey sprang from Keats’s reluctance to repeat the same word in\\nconsecutive lines, except in cases where a word’s music or meaning was to\\nbe emphasized.  The substitution of ‘its’ for ‘his’ in the sixth line is\\nmore difficult of explanation.  It was due probably to a desire on\\nKeats’s part not to mar by any echo the fine personification of Hesperus.\\n\\nIt may be noticed that Keats’s own eyes were brown, and not blue, as\\nstated by Mrs. Proctor to Lord Houghton.  Mrs. Speed showed me a note to\\nthat effect written by Mrs. George Keats on the margin of the page in\\nLord Houghton’s _Life_ (p. 100, vol. i.), where Mrs. Proctor’s\\ndescription is given.  Cowden Clarke made a similar correction in his\\n_Recollections_, and in some of the later editions of Lord Houghton’s\\nbook the word ‘blue’ is struck out.  In Severn’s portraits of Keats also\\nthe eyes are given as brown.\\n\\nThe exquisite sense of colour expressed in the ninth and tenth lines may\\nbe paralleled by\\n\\n    The Ocean with its vastness, its blue green,\\n\\nof the sonnet to George Keats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDINNERS AND DISHES\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, March 7, 1885.)\\n\\n\\nA man can live for three days without bread, but no man can live for one\\nday without poetry, was an aphorism of Baudelaire.  You can live without\\npictures and music but you cannot live without eating, says the author of\\n_Dinners and Dishes_; and this latter view is, no doubt, the more\\npopular.  Who, indeed, in these degenerate days would hesitate between an\\node and an omelette, a sonnet and a salmis?  Yet the position is not\\nentirely Philistine; cookery is an art; are not its principles the\\nsubject of South Kensington lectures, and does not the Royal Academy give\\na banquet once a year?  Besides, as the coming democracy will, no doubt,\\ninsist on feeding us all on penny dinners, it is well that the laws of\\ncookery should be explained: for were the national meal burned, or badly\\nseasoned, or served up with the wrong sauce a dreadful revolution might\\nfollow.\\n\\nUnder these circumstances we strongly recommend _Dinners and Dishes_ to\\nevery one: it is brief and concise and makes no attempt at eloquence,\\nwhich is extremely fortunate.  For even on ortolans who could endure\\noratory?  It also has the advantage of not being illustrated.  The\\nsubject of a work of art has, of course, nothing to do with its beauty,\\nbut still there is always something depressing about the coloured\\nlithograph of a leg of mutton.\\n\\nAs regards the author’s particular views, we entirely agree with him on\\nthe important question of macaroni.  ‘Never,’ he says, ‘ask me to back a\\nbill for a man who has given me a macaroni pudding.’  Macaroni is\\nessentially a savoury dish and may be served with cheese or tomatoes but\\nnever with sugar and milk.  There is also a useful description of how to\\ncook risotto—a delightful dish too rarely seen in England; an excellent\\nchapter on the different kinds of salads, which should be carefully\\nstudied by those many hostesses whose imaginations never pass beyond\\nlettuce and beetroot; and actually a recipe for making Brussels sprouts\\neatable.  The last is, of course, a masterpiece.\\n\\nThe real difficulty that we all have to face in life is not so much the\\nscience of cookery as the stupidity of cooks.  And in this little\\nhandbook to practical Epicureanism the tyrant of the English kitchen is\\nshown in her proper light.  Her entire ignorance of herbs, her passion\\nfor extracts and essences, her total inability to make a soup which is\\nanything more than a combination of pepper and gravy, her inveterate\\nhabit of sending up bread poultices with pheasants,—all these sins and\\nmany others are ruthlessly unmasked by the author.  Ruthlessly and\\nrightly.  For the British cook is a foolish woman who should be turned\\nfor her iniquities into a pillar of salt which she never knows how to\\nuse.\\n\\nBut our author is not local merely.  He has been in many lands; he has\\neaten back-hendl at Vienna and kulibatsch at St. Petersburg; he has had\\nthe courage to face the buffalo veal of Roumania and to dine with a\\nGerman family at one o’clock; he has serious views on the right method of\\ncooking those famous white truffles of Turin of which Alexandre Dumas was\\nso fond; and, in the face of the Oriental Club, declares that Bombay\\ncurry is better than the curry of Bengal.  In fact he seems to have had\\nexperience of almost every kind of meal except the ‘square meal’ of the\\nAmericans.  This he should study at once; there is a great field for the\\nphilosophic epicure in the United States.  Boston beans may be dismissed\\nat once as delusions, but soft-shell crabs, terrapin, canvas-back ducks,\\nblue fish and the pompono of New Orleans are all wonderful delicacies,\\nparticularly when one gets them at Delmonico’s.  Indeed, the two most\\nremarkable bits of scenery in the States are undoubtedly Delmonico’s and\\nthe Yosemité Valley; and the former place has done more to promote a good\\nfeeling between England and America than anything else has in this\\ncentury.\\n\\nWe hope the ‘Wanderer’ will go there soon and add a chapter to _Dinners\\nand Dishes_, and that his book will have in England the influence it\\ndeserves.  There are twenty ways of cooking a potato and three hundred\\nand sixty-five ways of cooking an egg, yet the British cook, up to the\\npresent moment, knows only three methods of sending up either one or the\\nother.\\n\\n_Dinners and Dishes_.  By ‘Wanderer.’  (Simpkin and Marshall.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHAKESPEARE ON SCENERY\\n(_Dramatic Review_, March 14, 1885.)\\n\\n\\nI have often heard people wonder what Shakespeare would say, could he see\\nMr. Irving’s production of his _Much Ado About Nothing_, or Mr. Wilson\\nBarrett’s setting of his _Hamlet_.  Would he take pleasure in the glory\\nof the scenery and the marvel of the colour?  Would he be interested in\\nthe Cathedral of Messina, and the battlements of Elsinore?  Or would he\\nbe indifferent, and say the play, and the play only, is the thing?\\n\\nSpeculations like these are always pleasurable, and in the present case\\nhappen to be profitable also.  For it is not difficult to see what\\nShakespeare’s attitude would be; not difficult, that is to say, if one\\nreads Shakespeare himself, instead of reading merely what is written\\nabout him.\\n\\nSpeaking, for instance, directly, as the manager of a London theatre,\\nthrough the lips of the chorus in _Henry V._, he complains of the\\nsmallness of the stage on which he has to produce the pageant of a big\\nhistorical play, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out\\nmany of its most picturesque incidents, apologises for the scanty number\\nof supers who had to play the soldiers, and for the shabbiness of the\\nproperties, and, finally, expresses his regret at being unable to bring\\non real horses.\\n\\nIn the _Midsummer Night’s Dream_, again, he gives us a most amusing\\npicture of the straits to which theatrical managers of his day were\\nreduced by the want of proper scenery.  In fact, it is impossible to read\\nhim without seeing that he is constantly protesting against the two\\nspecial limitations of the Elizabethan stage—the lack of suitable\\nscenery, and the fashion of men playing women’s parts, just as he\\nprotests against other difficulties with which managers of theatres have\\nstill to contend, such as actors who do not understand their words;\\nactors who miss their cues; actors who overact their parts; actors who\\nmouth; actors who gag; actors who play to the gallery, and amateur\\nactors.\\n\\nAnd, indeed, a great dramatist, as he was, could not but have felt very\\nmuch hampered at being obliged continually to interrupt the progress of a\\nplay in order to send on some one to explain to the audience that the\\nscene was to be changed to a particular place on the entrance of a\\nparticular character, and after his exit to somewhere else; that the\\nstage was to represent the deck of a ship in a storm, or the interior of\\na Greek temple, or the streets of a certain town, to all of which\\ninartistic devices Shakespeare is reduced, and for which he always amply\\napologizes.  Besides this clumsy method, Shakespeare had two other\\nsubstitutes for scenery—the hanging out of a placard, and his\\ndescriptions.  The first of these could hardly have satisfied his passion\\nfor picturesqueness and his feeling for beauty, and certainly did not\\nsatisfy the dramatic critic of his day.  But as regards the description,\\nto those of us who look on Shakespeare not merely as a playwright but as\\na poet, and who enjoy reading him at home just as much as we enjoy seeing\\nhim acted, it may be a matter of congratulation that he had not at his\\ncommand such skilled machinists as are in use now at the Princess’s and\\nat the Lyceum.  For had Cleopatra’s barge, for instance, been a structure\\nof canvas and Dutch metal, it would probably have been painted over or\\nbroken up after the withdrawal of the piece, and, even had it survived to\\nour own day, would, I am afraid, have become extremely shabby by this\\ntime.  Whereas now the beaten gold of its poop is still bright, and the\\npurple of its sails still beautiful; its silver oars are not tired of\\nkeeping time to the music of the flutes they follow, nor the Nereid’s\\nflower-soft hands of touching its silken tackle; the mermaid still lies\\nat its helm, and still on its deck stand the boys with their coloured\\nfans.  Yet lovely as all Shakespeare’s descriptive passages are, a\\ndescription is in its essence undramatic.  Theatrical audiences are far\\nmore impressed by what they look at than by what they listen to; and the\\nmodern dramatist, in having the surroundings of his play visibly\\npresented to the audience when the curtain rises, enjoys an advantage for\\nwhich Shakespeare often expresses his desire.  It is true that\\nShakespeare’s descriptions are not what descriptions are in modern\\nplays—accounts of what the audience can observe for themselves; they are\\nthe imaginative method by which he creates in the mind of the spectators\\nthe image of that which he desires them to see.  Still, the quality of\\nthe drama is action.  It is always dangerous to pause for\\npicturesqueness.  And the introduction of self-explanatory scenery\\nenables the modern method to be far more direct, while the loveliness of\\nform and colour which it gives us, seems to me often to create an\\nartistic temperament in the audience, and to produce that joy in beauty\\nfor beauty’s sake, without which the great masterpieces of art can never\\nbe understood, to which, and to which only, are they ever revealed.\\n\\nTo talk of the passion of a play being hidden by the paint, and of\\nsentiment being killed by scenery, is mere emptiness and folly of words.\\nA noble play, nobly mounted, gives us double artistic pleasure.  The eye\\nas well as the ear is gratified, and the whole nature is made exquisitely\\nreceptive of the influence of imaginative work.  And as regards a bad\\nplay, have we not all seen large audiences lured by the loveliness of\\nscenic effect into listening to rhetoric posing as poetry, and to\\nvulgarity doing duty for realism?  Whether this be good or evil for the\\npublic I will not here discuss, but it is evident that the playwright, at\\nany rate, never suffers.\\n\\nIndeed, the artist who really has suffered through the modern mounting of\\nplays is not the dramatist at all, but the scene-painter proper.  He is\\nrapidly being displaced by the stage-carpenter.  Now and then, at Drury\\nLane, I have seen beautiful old front cloths let down, as perfect as\\npictures some of them, and pure painter’s work, and there are many which\\nwe all remember at other theatres, in front of which some dialogue was\\nreduced to graceful dumb-show through the hammer and tin-tacks behind.\\nBut as a rule the stage is overcrowded with enormous properties, which\\nare not merely far more expensive and cumbersome than scene-paintings,\\nbut far less beautiful, and far less true.  Properties kill perspective.\\nA painted door is more like a real door than a real door is itself, for\\nthe proper conditions of light and shade can be given to it; and the\\nexcessive use of built-up structures always makes the stage too glaring,\\nfor as they have to be lit from behind, as well as from the front, the\\ngas-jets become the absolute light of the scene instead of the means\\nmerely by which we perceive the conditions of light and shadow which the\\npainter has desired to show us.\\n\\nSo, instead of bemoaning the position of the playwright, it were better\\nfor the critics to exert whatever influence they may possess towards\\nrestoring the scene-painter to his proper position as an artist, and not\\nallowing him to be built over by the property man, or hammered to death\\nby the carpenter.  I have never seen any reason myself why such artists\\nas Mr. Beverley, Mr. Walter Hann, and Mr. Telbin should not be entitled\\nto become Academicians.  They have certainly as good a claim as have many\\nof those R.A.’s whose total inability to paint we can see every May for a\\nshilling.\\n\\nAnd lastly, let those critics who hold up for our admiration the\\nsimplicity of the Elizabethan stage remember that they are lauding a\\ncondition of things against which Shakespeare himself, in the spirit of a\\ntrue artist, always strongly protested.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_HENRY THE FOURTH_ AT OXFORD\\n(_Dramatic Review_, May 23, 1885.)\\n\\n\\nI have been told that the ambition of every Dramatic Club is to act\\n_Henry IV_.  I am not surprised.  The spirit of comedy is as fervent in\\nthis play as is the spirit of chivalry; it is an heroic pageant as well\\nas an heroic poem, and like most of Shakespeare’s historical dramas it\\ncontains an extraordinary number of thoroughly good acting parts, each of\\nwhich is absolutely individual in character, and each of which\\ncontributes to the evolution of the plot.\\n\\nTo Oxford belongs the honour of having been the first to present on the\\nstage this noble play, and the production which I saw last week was in\\nevery way worthy of that lovely town, that mother of sweetness and of\\nlight.  For, in spite of the roaring of the young lions at the Union, and\\nthe screaming of the rabbits in the home of the vivisector, in spite of\\nKeble College, and the tramways, and the sporting prints, Oxford still\\nremains the most beautiful thing in England, and nowhere else are life\\nand art so exquisitely blended, so perfectly made one.  Indeed, in most\\nother towns art has often to present herself in the form of a reaction\\nagainst the sordid ugliness of ignoble lives, but at Oxford she comes to\\nus as an exquisite flower born of the beauty of life and expressive of\\nlife’s joy.  She finds her home by the Isis as once she did by the\\nIlissus; the Magdalen walks and the Magdalen cloisters are as dear to her\\nas were ever the silver olives of Colonus and the golden gateway of the\\nhouse of Pallas: she covers with fanlike tracery the vaulted entrance to\\nChrist Church Hall, and looks out from the windows of Merton; her feet\\nhave stirred the Cumnor cowslips, and she gathers fritillaries in the\\nriver-fields.  To her the clamour of the schools and the dullness of the\\nlecture-room are a weariness and a vexation of spirit; she seeks not to\\ndefine virtue, and cares little for the categories; she smiles on the\\nswift athlete whose plastic grace has pleased her, and rejoices in the\\nyoung Barbarians at their games; she watches the rowers from the reedy\\nbank and gives myrtle to her lovers, and laurels to her poets, and rue to\\nthose who talk wisely in the street; she makes the earth lovely to all\\nwho dream with Keats; she opens high heaven to all who soar with Shelley;\\nand turning away her head from pedant, proctor and Philistine, she has\\nwelcomed to her shrine a band of youthful actors, knowing that they have\\nsought with much ardour for the stern secret of Melpomene, and caught\\nwith much gladness the sweet laughter of Thalia.  And to me this ardour\\nand this gladness were the two most fascinating qualities of the Oxford\\nperformance, as indeed they are qualities which are necessary to any fine\\ndramatic production.  For without quick and imaginative observation of\\nlife the most beautiful play becomes dull in presentation, and what is\\nnot conceived in delight by the actor can give no delight at all to\\nothers.\\n\\nI know that there are many who consider that Shakespeare is more for the\\nstudy than for the stage.  With this view I do not for a moment agree.\\nShakespeare wrote the plays to be acted, and we have no right to alter\\nthe form which he himself selected for the full expression of his work.\\nIndeed, many of the beauties of that work can be adequately conveyed to\\nus only through the actor’s art.  As I sat in the Town Hall of Oxford the\\nother night, the majesty of the mighty lines of the play seemed to me to\\ngain new music from the clear young voices that uttered them, and the\\nideal grandeur of the heroism to be made more real to the spectators by\\nthe chivalrous bearing, the noble gesture and the fine passion of its\\nexponents.  Even the dresses had their dramatic value.  Their\\narchæological accuracy gave us, immediately on the rise of the curtain, a\\nperfect picture of the time.  As the knights and nobles moved across the\\nstage in the flowing robes of peace and in the burnished steel of battle,\\nwe needed no dreary chorus to tell us in what age or land the play’s\\naction was passing, for the fifteenth century in all the dignity and\\ngrace of its apparel was living actually before us, and the delicate\\nharmonies of colour struck from the first a dominant note of beauty which\\nadded to the intellectual realism of archæology the sensuous charm of\\nart.\\n\\nI have rarely seen a production better stage-managed.  Indeed, I hope\\nthat the University will take some official notice of this delightful\\nwork of art.  Why should not degrees be granted for good acting?  Are\\nthey not given to those who misunderstand Plato and who mistranslate\\nAristotle?  And should the artist be passed over?  No.  To Prince Hal,\\nHotspur and Falstaff, D.C.L.’s should be gracefully offered.  I feel sure\\nthey would be gracefully accepted.  To the rest of the company the\\ncrimson or the sheepskin hood might be assigned _honoris causâ_ to the\\neternal confusion of the Philistine, and the rage of the industrious and\\nthe dull.  Thus would Oxford confer honour on herself, and the artist be\\nplaced in his proper position.  However, whether or not Convocation\\nrecognizes the claims of culture, I hope that the Oxford Dramatic Society\\nwill produce every summer for us some noble play like _Henry IV_.  For,\\nin plays of this kind, plays which deal with bygone times, there is\\nalways this peculiar charm, that they combine in one exquisite\\npresentation the passions that are living with the picturesqueness that\\nis dead.  And when we have the modern spirit given to us in an antique\\nform, the very remoteness of that form can be made a method of increased\\nrealism.  This was Shakespeare’s own attitude towards the ancient world,\\nthis is the attitude we in this century should adopt towards his plays,\\nand with a feeling akin to this it seemed to me that these brilliant\\nyoung Oxonians were working.  If it was so, their aim is the right one.\\nFor while we look to the dramatist to give romance to realism, we ask of\\nthe actor to give realism to romance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA HANDBOOK TO MARRIAGE\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, November 18, 1885.)\\n\\n\\nIn spite of its somewhat alarming title this book may be highly\\nrecommended to every one.  As for the authorities the author quotes, they\\nare almost numberless, and range from Socrates down to Artemus Ward.  He\\ntells us of the wicked bachelor who spoke of marriage as ‘a very harmless\\namusement’ and advised a young friend of his to ‘marry early and marry\\noften’; of Dr. Johnson who proposed that marriage should be arranged by\\nthe Lord Chancellor, without the parties concerned having any choice in\\nthe matter; of the Sussex labourer who asked, ‘Why should I give a woman\\nhalf my victuals for cooking the other half?’ and of Lord Verulam who\\nthought that unmarried men did the best public work.  And, indeed,\\nmarriage is the one subject on which all women agree and all men\\ndisagree.  Our author, however, is clearly of the same opinion as the\\nScotch lassie who, on her father warning her what a solemn thing it was\\nto get married, answered, ‘I ken that, father, but it’s a great deal\\nsolemner to be single.’  He may be regarded as the champion of the\\nmarried life.  Indeed, he has a most interesting chapter on marriage-made\\nmen, and though he dissents, and we think rightly, from the view recently\\nput forward by a lady or two on the Women’s Rights platform that Solomon\\nowed all his wisdom to the number of his wives, still he appeals to\\nBismarck, John Stuart Mill, Mahommed, and Lord Beaconsfield, as instances\\nof men whose success can be traced to the influence of the women they\\nmarried.  Archbishop Whately once defined woman as ‘a creature that does\\nnot reason and pokes the fire from the top,’ but since his day the higher\\neducation of women has considerably altered their position.  Women have\\nalways had an emotional sympathy with those they love; Girton and Newnham\\nhave rendered intellectual sympathy also possible.  In our day it is best\\nfor a man to be married, and men must give up the tyranny in married life\\nwhich was once so dear to them, and which, we are afraid, lingers still,\\nhere and there.\\n\\n‘Do you wish to be my wife, Mabel?’ said a little boy.  ‘Yes,’\\nincautiously answered Mabel.  ‘Then pull off my boots.’\\n\\nOn marriage vows our author has, too, very sensible views and very\\namusing stories.  He tells of a nervous bridegroom who, confusing the\\nbaptismal and marriage ceremonies, replied when asked if he consented to\\ntake the bride for his wife: ‘I renounce them all’; of a Hampshire rustic\\nwho, when giving the ring, said solemnly to the bride: ‘With my body I\\nthee wash up, and with all my hurdle goods I thee and thou’; of another\\nwho when asked whether he would take his partner to be his wedded wife,\\nreplied with shameful indecision: ‘Yes, I’m willin’; but I’d a sight\\nrather have her sister’; and of a Scotch lady who, on the occasion of her\\ndaughter’s wedding, was asked by an old friend whether she might\\ncongratulate her on the event, and answered: ‘Yes, yes, upon the whole it\\nis very satisfactory; it is true Jeannie hates her gudeman, but then\\nthere’s always a something!’  Indeed, the good stories contained in this\\nbook are quite endless and make it very pleasant reading, while the good\\nadvice is on all points admirable.\\n\\nMost young married people nowadays start in life with a dreadful\\ncollection of ormolu inkstands covered with sham onyxes, or with a\\nperfect museum of salt-cellars.  We strongly recommend this book as one\\nof the best of wedding presents.  It is a complete handbook to an earthly\\nParadise, and its author may be regarded as the Murray of matrimony and\\nthe Baedeker of bliss.\\n\\n_How to be Happy though Married_: _Being a Handbook to Marriage_.  By a\\nGraduate in the University of Matrimony.  (T. Fisher Unwin.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTO READ OR NOT TO READ\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, February 8, 1886.)\\n\\n\\nBooks, I fancy, may be conveniently divided into three classes:\\n\\n1.  Books to read, such as Cicero’s _Letters_, Suetonius, Vasari’s _Lives\\nof the Painters_, the _Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini_, Sir John\\nMandeville, Marco Polo, St. Simon’s _Memoirs_, Mommsen, and (till we get\\na better one) Grote’s _History of Greece_.\\n\\n2.  Books to re-read, such as Plato and Keats: in the sphere of poetry,\\nthe masters not the minstrels; in the sphere of philosophy, the seers not\\nthe _savants_.\\n\\n3.  Books not to read at all, such as Thomson’s _Seasons_, Rogers’s\\n_Italy_, Paley’s _Evidences_, all the Fathers except St. Augustine, all\\nJohn Stuart Mill except the essay on _Liberty_, all Voltaire’s plays\\nwithout any exception, Butler’s _Analogy_, Grant’s _Aristotle_, Hume’s\\n_England_, Lewes’s _History of Philosophy_, all argumentative books and\\nall books that try to prove anything.\\n\\nThe third class is by far the most important.  To tell people what to\\nread is, as a rule, either useless or harmful; for, the appreciation of\\nliterature is a question of temperament not of teaching; to Parnassus\\nthere is no primer and nothing that one can learn is ever worth learning.\\nBut to tell people what not to read is a very different matter, and I\\nventure to recommend it as a mission to the University Extension Scheme.\\n\\nIndeed, it is one that is eminently needed in this age of ours, an age\\nthat reads so much, that it has no time to admire, and writes so much,\\nthat it has no time to think.  Whoever will select out of the chaos of\\nour modern curricula ‘The Worst Hundred Books,’ and publish a list of\\nthem, will confer on the rising generation a real and lasting benefit.\\n\\nAfter expressing these views I suppose I should not offer any suggestions\\nat all with regard to ‘The Best Hundred Books,’ but I hope you will allow\\nme the pleasure of being inconsistent, as I am anxious to put in a claim\\nfor a book that has been strangely omitted by most of the excellent\\njudges who have contributed to your columns.  I mean the _Greek\\nAnthology_.  The beautiful poems contained in this collection seem to me\\nto hold the same position with regard to Greek dramatic literature as do\\nthe delicate little figurines of Tanagra to the Phidian marbles, and to\\nbe quite as necessary for the complete understanding of the Greek spirit.\\n\\nI am also amazed to find that Edgar Allan Poe has been passed over.\\nSurely this marvellous lord of rhythmic expression deserves a place?  If,\\nin order to make room for him, it be necessary to elbow out some one\\nelse, I should elbow out Southey, and I think that Baudelaire might be\\nmost advantageously substituted for Keble.\\n\\nNo doubt, both in the _Curse of Kehama_ and in the _Christian Year_ there\\nare poetic qualities of a certain kind, but absolute catholicity of taste\\nis not without its dangers.  It is only an auctioneer who should admire\\nall schools of art.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LETTERS OF A GREAT WOMAN\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, March 6, 1886.)\\n\\n\\nOf the many collections of letters that have appeared in this century\\nfew, if any, can rival for fascination of style and variety of incident\\nthe letters of George Sand which have recently been translated into\\nEnglish by M. Ledos de Beaufort.  They extend over a space of more than\\nsixty years, from 1812 to 1876, in fact, and comprise the first letters\\nof Aurore Dupin, a child of eight years old, as well as the last letters\\nof George Sand, a woman of seventy-two.  The very early letters, those of\\nthe child and of the young married woman, possess, of course, merely a\\npsychological interest; but from 1831, the date of Madame Dudevant’s\\nseparation from her husband and her first entry into Paris life, the\\ninterest becomes universal, and the literary and political history of\\nFrance is mirrored in every page.\\n\\nFor George Sand was an indefatigable correspondent; she longs in one of\\nher letters, it is true, for ‘a planet where reading and writing are\\nabsolutely unknown,’ but still she had a real pleasure in letter-writing.\\nHer greatest delight was the communication of ideas, and she is always in\\nthe heart of the battle.  She discusses pauperism with Louis Napoleon in\\nhis prison at Ham, and liberty with Armand Barbes in his dungeon at\\nVincennes; she writes to Lamennais on philosophy, to Mazzini on\\nsocialism, to Lamartine on democracy, and to Ledru-Rollin on justice.\\nHer letters reveal to us not merely the life of a great novelist but the\\nsoul of a great woman, of a woman who was one with all the noblest\\nmovements of her day and whose sympathy with humanity was boundless\\nabsolutely.  For the aristocracy of intellect she had always the deepest\\nveneration, but the democracy of suffering touched her more.  She\\npreached the regeneration of mankind, not with the noisy ardour of the\\npaid advocate, but with the enthusiasm of the true evangelist.  Of all\\nthe artists of this century she was the most altruistic; she felt every\\none’s misfortunes except her own.  Her faith never left her; to the end\\nof her life, as she tells us, she was able to believe without illusions.\\nBut the people disappointed her a little.  She saw that they followed\\npersons not principles, and for ‘the great man theory’ George Sand had no\\nrespect.  ‘Proper names are the enemies of principles’ is one of her\\naphorisms.\\n\\nSo from 1850 her letters are more distinctly literary.  She discusses\\nmodern realism with Flaubert, and play-writing with Dumas _fils_; and\\nprotests with passionate vehemence against the doctrine of _L’art pour\\nl’art_.  ‘Art for the sake of itself is an idle sentence,’ she writes;\\n‘art for the sake of truth, for the sake of what is beautiful and good,\\nthat is the creed I seek.’  And in a delightful letter to M. Charles\\nPoncy she repeats the same idea very charmingly.  ‘People say that birds\\nsing for the sake of singing, but I doubt it.  They sing their loves and\\nhappiness, and in that they are in keeping with nature.  But man must do\\nsomething more, and poets only sing in order to move people and to make\\nthem think.’  She wanted M. Poncy to be the poet of the people and, if\\ngood advice were all that had been needed, he would certainly have been\\nthe Burns of the workshop.  She drew out a delightful scheme for a volume\\nto be called _Songs of all Trades_ and saw the possibilities of making\\nhandicrafts poetic.  Perhaps she valued good intentions in art a little\\ntoo much, and she hardly understood that art for art’s sake is not meant\\nto express the final cause of art but is merely a formula of creation;\\nbut, as she herself had scaled Parnassus, we must not quarrel at her\\nbringing Proletarianism with her.  For George Sand must be ranked among\\nour poetic geniuses.  She regarded the novel as still within the domain\\nof poetry.  Her heroes are not dead photographs; they are great\\npossibilities.  Modern novels are dissections; hers are dreams.  ‘I make\\npopular types,’ she writes, ‘such as I do no longer see, but such as they\\nshould and might be.’  For realism, in M. Zola’s acceptation of the word,\\nshe had no admiration.  Art to her was a mirror that transfigured truths\\nbut did not represent realities.  Hence she could not understand art\\nwithout personality.  ‘I am aware,’ she writes to Flaubert, ‘that you are\\nopposed to the exposition of personal doctrine in literature.  Are you\\nright?  Does not your opposition proceed rather from a want of conviction\\nthan from a principle of æsthetics?  If we have any philosophy in our\\nbrain it must needs break forth in our writings.  But you, as soon as you\\nhandle literature, you seem anxious, I know not why, to be another man,\\nthe one who must disappear, who annihilates himself and is no more.  What\\na singular mania!  What a deficient taste!  The worth of our productions\\ndepends entirely on our own.  Besides, if we withhold our own opinions\\nrespecting the personages we create, we naturally leave the reader in\\nuncertainty as to the opinion he should himself form of them.  That\\namounts to wishing not to be understood, and the result of this is that\\nthe reader gets weary of us and leaves us.’\\n\\nShe herself, however, may be said to have suffered from too dominant a\\npersonality, and this was the reason of the failure of most of her plays.\\n\\nOf the drama in the sense of disinterested presentation she had no idea,\\nand what is the strength and life-blood of her novels is the weakness of\\nher dramatic works.  But in the main she was right.  Art without\\npersonality is impossible.  And yet the aim of art is not to reveal\\npersonality, but to please.  This she hardly recognized in her æsthetics,\\nthough she realized it in her work.  On literary style she has some\\nexcellent remarks.  She dislikes the extravagances of the romantic school\\nand sees the beauty of simplicity.  ‘Simplicity,’ she writes, ‘is the\\nmost difficult thing to secure in this world: it is the last limit of\\nexperience and the last effort of genius.’  She hated the slang and\\n_argot_ of Paris life, and loved the words used by the peasants in the\\nprovinces.  ‘The provinces,’ she remarks, ‘preserve the tradition of the\\noriginal tongue and create but few new words.  I feel much respect for\\nthe language of the peasantry; in my estimation it is the more correct.’\\n\\nShe thought Flaubert too much preoccupied with the sense of form, and\\nmakes these excellent observations to him—perhaps her best piece of\\nliterary criticism.  ‘You consider the form as the aim, whereas it is but\\nthe effect.  Happy expressions are only the outcome of emotion and\\nemotion itself proceeds from a conviction.  We are only moved by that\\nwhich we ardently believe in.’  Literary schools she distrusted.\\nIndividualism was to her the keystone of art as well as of life.  ‘Do not\\nbelong to any school: do not imitate any model,’ is her advice.  Yet she\\nnever encouraged eccentricity.  ‘Be correct,’ she writes to Eugène\\nPelletan, ‘that is rarer than being eccentric, as the time goes.  It is\\nmuch more common to please by bad taste than to receive the cross of\\nhonour.’\\n\\nOn the whole, her literary advice is sound and healthy.  She never\\nshrieks and she never sneers.  She is the incarnation of good sense.  And\\nthe whole collection of her letters is a perfect treasure-house of\\nsuggestions both on art and on politics.\\n\\n_Letters of George Sand_.  Translated and edited by Raphael Ledos de\\nBeaufort.  (Ward and Downey.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBÉRANGER IN ENGLAND\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, April 21, 1886.)\\n\\n\\nA philosophic politician once remarked that the best possible form of\\ngovernment is an absolute monarchy tempered by street ballads.\\n\\nWithout at all agreeing with this aphorism we still cannot but regret\\nthat the new democracy does not use poetry as a means for the expression\\nof political opinion.  The Socialists, it is true, have been heard\\nsinging the later poems of Mr. William Morris, but the street ballad is\\nreally dead in England.  The fact is that most modern poetry is so\\nartificial in its form, so individual in its essence and so literary in\\nits style, that the people as a body are little moved by it, and when\\nthey have grievances against the capitalist or the aristocrat they prefer\\nstrikes to sonnets and rioting to rondels.\\n\\nPossibly, Mr. William Toynbee’s pleasant little volume of translations\\nfrom Béranger may be the herald of a new school.  Béranger had all the\\nqualifications for a popular poet.  He wrote to be sung more than to be\\nread; he preferred the Pont Neuf to Parnassus; he was patriotic as well\\nas romantic, and humorous as well as humane.  Translations of poetry as a\\nrule are merely misrepresentations, but the muse of Béranger is so simple\\nand naïve that she can wear our English dress with ease and grace, and\\nMr. Toynbee has kept much of the mirth and music of the original.  Here\\nand there, undoubtedly, the translation could be improved upon; ‘rapiers’\\nfor instance is an abominable rhyme to ‘forefathers’; ‘the hated arms of\\nAlbion’ in the same poem is a very feeble rendering of ‘le léopard de\\nl’Anglais,’ and such a verse as\\n\\n    ’Mid France’s miracles of art,\\n       Rare trophies won from art’s own land,\\n    I’ve lived to see with burning heart\\n       The fog-bred poor triumphant stand,\\n\\nreproduces very inadequately the charm of the original:\\n\\n    Dans nos palais, où, près de la victoire,\\n    Brillaient les arts, doux fruits des beaux climats,\\n    J’ai vu du Nord les peuplades sans gloire,\\n    De leurs manteaux secouer les frimas.\\n\\nOn the whole, however, Mr. Toynbee’s work is good; _Les Champs_, for\\nexample, is very well translated, and so are the two delightful poems\\n_Rosette_ and _Ma République_; and there is a good deal of spirit in _Le\\nMarquis de Carabas_:\\n\\n    Whom have we here in conqueror’s _rôle_?\\n    Our grand old marquis, bless his soul!\\n    Whose grand old charger (mark his bone!)\\n    Has borne him back to claim his own.\\n    Note, if you please, the grand old style\\n    In which he nears his grand old pile;\\n    With what an air of grand old state\\n    He waves that blade immaculate!\\n       Hats off, hats off, for my lord to pass,\\n       The grand old Marquis of Carabas!—\\n\\nthough ‘that blade immaculate’ has hardly got the sting of ‘un sabre\\ninnocent’; and in the fourth verse of the same poem, ‘Marquise, you’ll\\nhave the bed-chamber’ does not very clearly convey the sense of the line\\n‘La Marquise a le tabouret.’  Béranger is not nearly well enough known in\\nEngland, and though it is always better to read a poet in the original,\\nstill translations have their value as echoes have their music.\\n\\n_A Selection from the Songs of De Béranger in English Verse_.  By William\\nToynbee.  (Kegan Paul.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE POETRY OF THE PEOPLE\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, May 13, 1886.)\\n\\n\\nThe Countess Martinengo deserves well of all poets, peasants and\\npublishers.  Folk-lore is so often treated nowadays merely from the point\\nof view of the comparative mythologist, that it is really delightful to\\ncome across a book that deals with the subject simply as literature.  For\\nthe Folk-tale is the father of all fiction as the Folk-song is the mother\\nof all poetry; and in the games, the tales and the ballads of primitive\\npeople it is easy to see the germs of such perfected forms of art as the\\ndrama, the novel and the epic.  It is, of course, true that the highest\\nexpression of life is to be found not in the popular songs, however\\npoetical, of any nation, but in the great masterpieces of self-conscious\\nArt; yet it is pleasant sometimes to leave the summit of Parnassus to\\nlook at the wildflowers in the valley, and to turn from the lyre of\\nApollo to listen to the reed of Pan.  We can still listen to it.  To this\\nday, the vineyard dressers of Calabria will mock the passer-by with\\nsatirical verses as they used to do in the old pagan days, and the\\npeasants of the olive woods of Provence answer each other in amœbæan\\nstrains.  The Sicilian shepherd has not yet thrown his pipe aside, and\\nthe children of modern Greece sing the swallow-song through the villages\\nin spring-time, though Theognis is more than two thousand years dead.\\nNor is this popular poetry merely the rhythmic expression of joy and\\nsorrow; it is in the highest degree imaginative; and taking its\\ninspiration directly from nature it abounds in realistic metaphor and in\\npicturesque and fantastic imagery.  It must, of course, be admitted that\\nthere is a conventionality of nature as there is a conventionality of\\nart, and that certain forms of utterance are apt to become stereotyped by\\ntoo constant use; yet, on the whole, it is impossible not to recognize in\\nthe Folk-songs that the Countess Martinengo has brought together one\\nstrong dominant note of fervent and flawless sincerity.  Indeed, it is\\nonly in the more terrible dramas of the Elizabethan age that we can find\\nany parallel to the Corsican _voceri_ with their shrill intensity of\\npassion, their awful frenzies of grief and hate.

By the Countess Evelyn Martinengo\\nCésaresco.  (Redway.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_THE CENCI_\\n(_Dramatic Review_, May 15, 1886.)\\n\\n\\nThe production of _The Cenci_ last week at the Grand Theatre, Islington,\\nmay be said to have been an era in the literary history of this century,\\nand the Shelley Society deserves the highest praise and warmest thanks of\\nall for having given us an opportunity of seeing Shelley’s play under the\\nconditions he himself desired for it.  For _The Cenci_ was written\\nabsolutely with a view to theatric presentation, and had Shelley’s own\\nwishes been carried out it would have been produced during his lifetime\\nat Covent Garden, with Edmund Kean and Miss O’Neill in the principal\\nparts.  In working out his conception, Shelley had studied very carefully\\nthe æsthetics of dramatic art.  He saw that the essence of the drama is\\ndisinterested presentation, and that the characters must not be merely\\nmouthpieces for splendid poetry but must be living subjects for terror\\nand for pity.  ‘I have endeavoured,’ he says, ‘as nearly as possible to\\nrepresent the characters as they probably were, and have sought to avoid\\nthe error of making them actuated by my own conception of right or wrong,\\nfalse or true: thus under a thin veil converting names and actions of the\\nsixteenth century into cold impersonations of my own mind. . . .\\n\\n‘I have avoided with great care the introduction of what is commonly\\ncalled mere poetry, and I imagine there will scarcely be found a detached\\nsimile or a single isolated description, unless Beatrice’s description of\\nthe chasm appointed for her father’s murder should be judged to be of\\nthat nature.’\\n\\nHe recognized that a dramatist must be allowed far greater freedom of\\nexpression than what is conceded to a poet.  ‘In a dramatic composition,’\\nto use his own words, ‘the imagery and the passion should interpenetrate\\none another, the former being reserved simply for the full development\\nand illustration of the latter.  Imagination is as the immortal God which\\nshould assume flesh for the redemption of mortal passion.  It is thus\\nthat the most remote and the most familiar imagery may alike be fit for\\ndramatic purposes when employed in the illustration of strong feeling,\\nwhich raises what is low, and levels to the apprehension that which is\\nlofty, casting over all the shadow of its own greatness.  In other\\nrespects I have written more carelessly, that is, without an\\nover-fastidious and learned choice of words.  In this respect I entirely\\nagree with those modern critics who assert that in order to move men to\\ntrue sympathy we must use the familiar language of men.’\\n\\nHe knew that if the dramatist is to teach at all it must be by example,\\nnot by precept.\\n\\n‘The highest moral purpose,’ he remarks, ‘aimed at in the highest species\\nof the drama, is the teaching the human heart, through its sympathies and\\nantipathies, the knowledge of itself; in proportion to the possession of\\nwhich knowledge every human being is wise, just, sincere, tolerant and\\nkind.  If dogmas can do more it is well: but a drama is no fit place for\\nthe enforcement of them.’  He fully realizes that it is by a conflict\\nbetween our artistic sympathies and our moral judgment that the greatest\\ndramatic effects are produced.  ‘It is in the restless and anatomizing\\ncasuistry with which men seek the justification of Beatrice, yet feel\\nthat she has done what needs justification; it is in the superstitious\\nhorror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs and their revenge,\\nthat the dramatic character of what she did and suffered consists.’\\n\\nIn fact no one has more clearly understood than Shelley the mission of\\nthe dramatist and the meaning of the drama.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBALZAC IN ENGLISH\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, September 13, 1886.)\\n\\n\\nMany years ago, in a number of _All the Year Round_, Charles Dickens\\ncomplained that Balzac was very little read in England, and although\\nsince then the public has become more familiar with the great\\nmasterpieces of French fiction, still it may be doubted whether the\\n_Comédie Humaine_ is at all appreciated or understood by the general run\\nof novel readers.  It is really the greatest monument that literature has\\nproduced in our century, and M. Taine hardly exaggerates when he says\\nthat, after Shakespeare, Balzac is our most important magazine of\\ndocuments on human nature.  Balzac’s aim, in fact, was to do for humanity\\nwhat Buffon had done for the animal creation.  As the naturalist studied\\nlions and tigers, so the novelist studied men and women.  Yet he was no\\nmere reporter.  Photography and _procès-verbal_ were not the essentials\\nof his method.  Observation gave him the facts of life, but his genius\\nconverted facts into truths, and truths into truth.  He was, in a word, a\\nmarvellous combination of the artistic temperament with the scientific\\nspirit.  The latter he bequeathed to his disciples; the former was\\nentirely his own.  The distinction between such a book as M. Zola’s\\n_L’Assommoir_ and such a book as Balzac’s _Illusions Perdues_ is the\\ndistinction between unimaginative realism and imaginative reality.  ‘All\\nBalzac’s characters,’ said Baudelaire, ‘are gifted with the same ardour\\nof life that animated himself.  All his fictions are as deeply coloured\\nas dreams.  Every mind is a weapon loaded to the muzzle with will.  The\\nvery scullions have genius.’  He was, of course, accused of being\\nimmoral.  Few writers who deal directly with life escape that charge.\\nHis answer to the accusation was characteristic and conclusive.  ‘Whoever\\ncontributes his stone to the edifice of ideas,’ he wrote, ‘whoever\\nproclaims an abuse, whoever sets his mark upon an evil to be abolished,\\nalways passes for immoral.  If you are true in your portraits, if, by\\ndint of daily and nightly toil, you succeed in writing the most difficult\\nlanguage in the world, the word immoral is thrown in your face.’  The\\nmorals of the personages of the _Comédie Humaine_ are simply the morals\\nof the world around us.  They are part of the artist’s subject-matter;\\nthey are not part of his method.  If there be any need of censure it is\\nto life, not to literature, that it should be given.  Balzac, besides, is\\nessentially universal.  He sees life from every point of view.  He has no\\npreferences and no prejudices.  He does not try to prove anything.  He\\nfeels that the spectacle of life contains its own secret.  ‘Il crée un\\nmonde et se tait.’\\n\\nAnd what a world it is!  What a panorama of passions!  What a pell-mell\\nof men and women!  It was said of Trollope that he increased the number\\nof our acquaintances without adding to our visiting list; but after the\\n_Comédie Humaine_ one begins to believe that the only real people are the\\npeople who never existed.  Lucien de Rubempré, le Père Goriot, Ursule\\nMirouët, Marguerite Claës, the Baron Hulot, Madame Marneffe, le Cousin\\nPons, De Marsay—all bring with them a kind of contagious illusion of\\nlife.  They have a fierce vitality about them: their existence is fervent\\nand fiery-coloured; we not merely feel for them but we see them—they\\ndominate our fancy and defy scepticism.  A steady course of Balzac\\nreduces our living friends to shadows, and our acquaintances to the\\nshadows of shades.  Who would care to go out to an evening party to meet\\nTomkins, the friend of one’s boyhood, when one can sit at home with\\nLucien de Rubempré?  It is pleasanter to have the entrée to Balzac’s\\nsociety than to receive cards from all the duchesses in Mayfair.\\n\\nIn spite of this, there are many people who have declared the _Comédie\\nHumaine_ to be indigestible.  Perhaps it is: but then what about\\ntruffles?  Balzac’s publisher refused to be disturbed by any such\\ncriticism as that.  ‘Indigestible, is it?’ he exclaimed with what, for a\\npublisher, was rare good sense.  ‘Well, I should hope so; who ever thinks\\nof a dinner that isn’t?’\\n\\nBalzac’s Novels in English.  _The Duchesse de Langeais and Other\\nStories_; _César Birotteau_.  (Routledge and Sons.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBEN JONSON\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, September 20, 1886.)\\n\\n\\nAs for Mr. Symonds’ estimate of Jonson’s genius, it is in many points\\nquite excellent.  He ranks him with the giants rather than with the gods,\\nwith those who compel our admiration by their untiring energy and huge\\nstrength of intellectual muscle, not with those ‘who share the divine\\ngifts of creative imagination and inevitable instinct.’  Here he is\\nright.  Pelion more than Parnassus was Jonson’s home.  His art has too\\nmuch effort about it, too much definite intention.  His style lacks the\\ncharm of chance.  Mr. Symonds is right also in the stress he lays on the\\nextraordinary combination in Jonson’s work of the most concentrated\\nrealism with encyclopædic erudition.  In Jonson’s comedies London slang\\nand learned scholarship go hand in hand.  Literature was as living a\\nthing to him as life itself.  He used his classical lore not merely to\\ngive form to his verse, but to give flesh and blood to the persons of his\\nplays.  He could build up a breathing creature out of quotations.  He\\nmade the poets of Greece and Rome terribly modern, and introduced them to\\nthe oddest company.  His very culture is an element in his coarseness.\\nThere are moments when one is tempted to liken him to a beast that has\\nfed off books.\\n\\nWe cannot, however, agree with Mr. Symonds when he says that Jonson\\n‘rarely touched more than the outside of character,’ that his men and\\nwomen are ‘the incarnations of abstract properties rather than living\\nhuman beings,’ that they are in fact mere ‘masqueraders and mechanical\\npuppets.’  Eloquence is a beautiful thing but rhetoric ruins many a\\ncritic, and Mr. Symonds is essentially rhetorical.  When, for instance,\\nhe tells us that ‘Jonson made masks,’ while ‘Dekker and Heywood created\\nsouls,’ we feel that he is asking us to accept a crude judgment for the\\nsake of a smart antithesis.  It is, of course, true that we do not find\\nin Jonson the same growth of character that we find in Shakespeare, and\\nwe may admit that most of the characters in Jonson’s plays are, so to\\nspeak, ready-made.  But a ready-made character is not necessarily either\\nmechanical or wooden, two epithets Mr. Symonds uses constantly in his\\ncriticism.\\n\\nWe cannot tell, and Shakespeare himself does not tell us, why Iago is\\nevil, why Regan and Goneril have hard hearts, or why Sir Andrew Aguecheek\\nis a fool.  It is sufficient that they are what they are, and that nature\\ngives warrant for their existence.  If a character in a play is lifelike,\\nif we recognize it as true to nature, we have no right to insist on the\\nauthor explaining its genesis to us.  We must accept it as it is: and in\\nthe hands of a good dramatist mere presentation can take the place of\\nanalysis, and indeed is often a more dramatic method, because a more\\ndirect one.  And Jonson’s characters are true to nature.  They are in no\\nsense abstractions; they are types.  Captain Bobadil and Captain Tucca,\\nSir John Daw and Sir Amorous La Foole, Volpone and Mosca, Subtle and Sir\\nEpicure Mammon, Mrs. Purecraft and the Rabbi Busy are all creatures of\\nflesh and blood, none the less lifelike because they are labelled.  In\\nthis point Mr. Symonds seems to us unjust towards Jonson.\\n\\nWe think, also, that a special chapter might have been devoted to Jonson\\nas a literary critic.  The creative activity of the English Renaissance\\nis so great that its achievements in the sphere of criticism are often\\noverlooked by the student.  Then, for the first time, was language\\ntreated as an art.  The laws of expression and composition were\\ninvestigated and formularized.  The importance of words was recognized.\\nRomanticism, Realism and Classicism fought their first battles.  The\\ndramatists are full of literary and art criticisms, and amused the public\\nwith slashing articles on one another in the form of plays.\\n\\n‘English Worthies.’  Edited by Andrew Lang.  _Ben Jonson_.  By John\\nAddington Symonds.  (Longmans, Green and Co.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMR. SYMONDS’ HISTORY OF THE RENAISSANCE\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, November 10, 1886.)\\n\\n\\nMr. Symonds has at last finished his history of the Italian Renaissance.\\nThe two volumes just published deal with the intellectual and moral\\nconditions in Italy during the seventy years of the sixteenth century\\nwhich followed the coronation of Charles the Fifth at Bologna, an era to\\nwhich Mr. Symonds gives the name of the Catholic Reaction, and they\\ncontain a most interesting and valuable account of the position of Spain\\nin the Italian peninsula, the conduct of the Tridentine Council, the\\nspecific organization of the Holy Office and the Company of Jesus, and\\nthe state of society upon which those forces were brought to bear.  In\\nhis previous volumes Mr. Symonds had regarded the past rather as a\\npicture to be painted than as a problem to be solved.  In these two last\\nvolumes, however, he shows a clearer appreciation of the office of\\nhistory.  The art of the picturesque chronicler is completed by something\\nlike the science of the true historian, the critical spirit begins to\\nmanifest itself, and life is not treated as a mere spectacle, but the\\nlaws of its evolution and progress are investigated also.  We admit that\\nthe desire to represent life at all costs under dramatic conditions still\\naccompanies Mr. Symonds, and that he hardly realizes that what seems\\nromance to us was harsh reality to those who were engaged in it.  Like\\nmost dramatists, also, he is more interested in the psychological\\nexceptions than in the general rule.  He has something of Shakespeare’s\\nsovereign contempt of the masses.  The people stir him very little, but\\nhe is fascinated by great personalities.  Yet it is only fair to remember\\nthat the age itself was one of exaggerated individualism, and that\\nliterature had not yet become a mouthpiece for the utterances of\\nhumanity.  Men appreciated the aristocracy of intellect, but with the\\ndemocracy of suffering they had no sympathy.  The cry from the\\nbrickfields had still to be heard.  Mr. Symonds’ style, too, has much\\nimproved.  Here and there, it is true, we come across traces of the old\\nmanner, as in the apocalyptic vision of the seven devils that entered\\nItaly with the Spaniard, and the description of the Inquisition as a\\nBelial-Moloch, a ‘hideous idol whose face was blackened with soot from\\nburning human flesh.’  Such a sentence, also, as ‘over the Dead Sea of\\nsocial putrefaction floated the sickening oil of Jesuitical hypocrisy,’\\nreminds us that rhetoric has not yet lost its charms for Mr. Symonds.\\nStill, on the whole, the style shows far more reserve, balance and\\nsobriety, than can be found in the earlier volumes where violent\\nantithesis forms the predominant characteristic, and accuracy is often\\nsacrificed to an adjective.\\n\\nAmongst the most interesting chapters of the book are those on the\\nInquisition, on Sarpi, the great champion of the severance of Church from\\nState, and on Giordano Bruno.  Indeed, the story of Bruno’s life, from\\nhis visit to London and Oxford, his sojourn in Paris and wanderings\\nthrough Germany, down to his betrayal at Venice and martyrdom at Rome, is\\nmost powerfully told, and the estimate of the value of his philosophy and\\nthe relation he holds to modern science, is at once just and\\nappreciative.  The account also of Ignatius Loyola and the rise of the\\nSociety of Jesus is extremely interesting, though we cannot think that\\nMr. Symonds is very happy in his comparison of the Jesuits to ‘fanatics\\nlaying stones upon a railway’ or ‘dynamiters blowing up an emperor or a\\ncorner of Westminster Hall.’  Such a judgment is harsh and crude in\\nexpression and more suitable to the clamour of the Protestant Union than\\nto the dignity of the true historian.  Mr. Symonds, however, is rarely\\ndeliberately unfair, and there is no doubt but that his work on the\\nCatholic Reaction is a most valuable contribution to modern history—so\\nvaluable, indeed, that in the account he gives of the Inquisition in\\nVenice it would be well worth his while to bring the picturesque fiction\\nof the text into some harmony with the plain facts of the footnote.\\n\\nOn the poetry of the sixteenth century Mr. Symonds has, of course, a\\ngreat deal to say, and on such subjects he always writes with ease,\\ngrace, and delicacy of perception.  We admit that we weary sometimes of\\nthe continual application to literature of epithets appropriate to\\nplastic and pictorial art.  The conception of the unity of the arts is\\ncertainly of great value, but in the present condition of criticism it\\nseems to us that it would be more useful to emphasize the fact that each\\nart has its separate method of expression.  The essay on Tasso, however,\\nis delightful reading, and the position the poet holds towards modern\\nmusic and modern sentiment is analysed with much subtlety.  The essay on\\nMarino also is full of interest.  We have often wondered whether those\\nwho talk so glibly of Euphuism and Marinism in literature have ever read\\neither _Euphues_ or the _Adone_.  To the latter they can have no better\\nguide than Mr. Symonds, whose description of the poem is most\\nfascinating.  Marino, like many greater men, has suffered much from his\\ndisciples, but he himself was a master of graceful fancy and of exquisite\\nfelicity of phrase; not, of course, a great poet but certainly an artist\\nin poetry and one to whom language is indebted.  Even those conceits that\\nMr. Symonds feels bound to censure have something charming about them.\\nThe continual use of periphrases is undoubtedly a grave fault in style,\\nyet who but a pedant would really quarrel with such periphrases as\\n_sirena de’ boschi_ for the nightingale, or _il novello Edimione_ for\\nGalileo?\\n\\nFrom the poets Mr. Symonds passes to the painters: not those great\\nartists of Florence and Venice of whom he has already written, but the\\nEclectics of Bologna, the Naturalists of Naples and Rome.  This chapter\\nis too polemical to be pleasant.  The one on music is much better, and\\nMr. Symonds gives us a most interesting description of the gradual steps\\nby which the Italian genius passed from poetry and painting to melody and\\nsong, till the whole of Europe thrilled with the marvel and mystery of\\nthis new language of the soul.  Some small details should perhaps be\\nnoticed.  It is hardly accurate, for instance, to say that Monteverde’s\\n_Orfeo_ was the first form of the recitative-Opera, as Peri’s _Dafne_ and\\n_Euridice_ and Cavaliere’s _Rappresentazione_ preceded it by some years,\\nand it is somewhat exaggerated to say that ‘under the regime of the\\nCommonwealth the national growth of English music received a check from\\nwhich it never afterwards recovered,’ as it was with Cromwell’s auspices\\nthat the first English Opera was produced, thirteen years before any\\nOpera was regularly established in Paris.  The fact that England did not\\nmake such development in music as Italy and Germany did, must be ascribed\\nto other causes than ‘the prevalence of Puritan opinion.’\\n\\nThese, however, are minor points.  Mr. Symonds is to be warmly\\ncongratulated on the completion of his history of the Renaissance in\\nItaly.  It is a most wonderful monument of literary labour, and its value\\nto the student of Humanism cannot be doubted.  We have often had occasion\\nto differ from Mr. Symonds on questions of detail, and we have more than\\nonce felt it our duty to protest against the rhetoric and over-emphasis\\nof his style, but we fully recognize the importance of his work and the\\nimpetus he has given to the study of one of the vital periods of the\\nworld’s history.  Mr. Symonds’ learning has not made him a pedant; his\\nculture has widened not narrowed his sympathies, and though he can hardly\\nbe called a great historian, yet he will always occupy a place in English\\nliterature as one of the remarkable men of letters in the nineteenth\\ncentury.\\n\\n_Renaissance in Italy_: _The Catholic Reaction_.  In Two Parts.  By John\\nAddington Symonds.  (Smith, Elder and Co.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMR. MORRIS’S _ODYSSEY_\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, April 26, 1887.)\\n\\n\\nOf all our modern poets, Mr. William Morris is the one best qualified by\\nnature and by art to translate for us the marvellous epic of the\\nwanderings of Odysseus.  For he is our only true story-singer since\\nChaucer; if he is a Socialist, he is also a Saga-man; and there was a\\ntime when he was never wearied of telling us strange legends of gods and\\nmen, wonderful tales of chivalry and romance.  Master as he is of\\ndecorative and descriptive verse, he has all the Greek’s joy in the\\nvisible aspect of things, all the Greek’s sense of delicate and\\ndelightful detail, all the Greek’s pleasure in beautiful textures and\\nexquisite materials and imaginative designs; nor can any one have a\\nkeener sympathy with the Homeric admiration for the workers and the\\ncraftsmen in the various arts, from the stainers in white ivory and the\\nembroiderers in purple and gold, to the weaver sitting by the loom and\\nthe dyer dipping in the vat, the chaser of shield and helmet, the carver\\nof wood or stone.  And to all this is added the true temper of high\\nromance, the power to make the past as real to us as the present, the\\nsubtle instinct to discern passion, the swift impulse to portray life.\\n\\nIt is no wonder the lovers of Greek literature have so eagerly looked\\nforward to Mr. Morris’s version of the Odyssean epic, and now that the\\nfirst volume has appeared, it is not extravagant to say that of all our\\nEnglish translations this is the most perfect and the most satisfying.\\nIn spite of Coleridge’s well-known views on the subject, we have always\\nheld that Chapman’s _Odyssey_ is immeasurably inferior to his _Iliad_,\\nthe mere difference of metre alone being sufficient to set the former in\\na secondary place; Pope’s _Odyssey_, with its glittering rhetoric and\\nsmart antithesis, has nothing of the grand manner of the original; Cowper\\nis dull, and Bryant dreadful, and Worsley too full of Spenserian\\nprettinesses; while excellent though Messrs. Butcher and Lang’s version\\nundoubtedly is in many respects, still, on the whole, it gives us merely\\nthe facts of the _Odyssey_ without providing anything of its artistic\\neffect.  Avia’s translation even, though better than almost all its\\npredecessors in the same field, is not worthy of taking rank beside Mr.\\nMorris’s, for here we have a true work of art, a rendering not merely of\\nlanguage into language, but of poetry into poetry, and though the new\\nspirit added in the transfusion may seem to many rather Norse than Greek,\\nand, perhaps at times, more boisterous than beautiful, there is yet a\\nvigour of life in every line, a splendid ardour through each canto, that\\nstirs the blood while one reads like the sound of a trumpet, and that,\\nproducing a physical as well as a spiritual delight, exults the senses no\\nless than it exalts the soul.  It may be admitted at once that, here and\\nthere, Mr. Morris has missed something of the marvellous dignity of the\\nHomeric verse, and that, in his desire for rushing and ringing metre, he\\nhas occasionally sacrificed majesty to movement, and made stateliness\\ngive place to speed; but it is really only in such blank verse as\\nMilton’s that this effect of calm and lofty music can be attained, and in\\nall other respects blank verse is the most inadequate medium for\\nreproducing the full flow and fervour of the Greek hexameter.  One merit,\\nat any rate, Mr. Morris’s version entirely and absolutely possesses.  It\\nis, in no sense of the word, literary; it seems to deal immediately with\\nlife itself, and to take from the reality of things its own form and\\ncolour; it is always direct and simple, and at its best has something of\\nthe ‘large utterance of the early gods.’\\n\\nAs for individual passages of beauty, nothing could be better than the\\nwonderful description of the house of the Phœacian king, or the whole\\ntelling of the lovely legend of Circe, or the manner in which the pageant\\nof the pale phantoms in Hades is brought before our eyes.  Perhaps the\\nhuge epic humour of the escape from the Cyclops is hardly realized, but\\nthere is always a linguistic difficulty about rendering this fascinating\\nstory into English, and where we are given so much poetry we should not\\ncomplain about losing a pun; and the exquisite idyll of the meeting and\\nparting with the daughter of Alcinous is really delightfully told.  How\\ngood, for instance, is this passage taken at random from the Sixth Book:\\n\\n    But therewith unto the handmaids goodly Odysseus spake:\\n    ‘Stand off I bid you, damsels, while the work in hand I take,\\n    And wash the brine from my shoulders, and sleek them all around.\\n    Since verily now this long while sweet oil they have not found.\\n    But before you nought will I wash me, for shame I have indeed,\\n    Amidst of fair-tressed damsels to be all bare of weed.’\\n    So he spake and aloof they gat them, and thereof they told the may,\\n    But Odysseus with the river from his body washed away\\n    The brine from his back and shoulders wrought broad and mightily,\\n    And from his head was he wiping the foam of the untilled sea;\\n    But when he had thoroughly washed him, and the oil about him had\\n    shed,\\n    He did upon the raiment the gift of the maid unwed.\\n    But Athene, Zeus-begotten, dealt with him in such wise\\n    That bigger yet was his seeming, and mightier to all eyes,\\n    With the hair on his head crisp curling as the bloom of the daffodil.\\n    And as when the silver with gold is o’erlaid by a man of skill,\\n    Yea, a craftsman whom Hephæstus and Pallas Athene have taught\\n    To be master over masters, and lovely work he hath wrought;\\n    So she round his head and his shoulders shed grace abundantly.\\n\\nIt may be objected by some that the line\\n\\n    With the hair on his head crisp curling as the bloom of the daffodil,\\n\\nis a rather fanciful version of\\n\\n    ουλας ηκε κόμας, ύακινθίνω ανθει όμοιασ\\n\\nand it certainly seems probable that the allusion is to the dark colour\\nof the hero’s hair; still, the point is not one of much importance,\\nthough it may be worth noting that a similar expression occurs in\\nOgilby’s superbly illustrated translation of the _Odyssey_, published in\\n1665, where Charles II.’s Master of the Revels in Ireland gives the\\npassage thus:\\n\\n    Minerva renders him more tall and fair,\\n    Curling in rings like daffodils his hair.\\n\\nNo anthology, however, can show the true merit of Mr. Morris’s\\ntranslation, whose real merit does not depend on stray beauties, nor is\\nrevealed by chance selections, but lies in the absolute rightness and\\ncoherence of the whole, in its purity and justice of touch, its freedom\\nfrom affectation and commonplace, its harmony of form and matter.  It is\\nsufficient to say that this is a poet’s version of a poet, and for such\\nsurely we should be thankful.  In these latter days of coarse and vulgar\\nliterature, it is something to have made the great sea-epic of the South\\nnative and natural to our northern isle, something to have shown that our\\nEnglish speech may be a pipe through which Greek lips can blow, something\\nto have taught Nausicaa to speak the same language as Perdita.\\n\\n_The Odyssey of Homer_.

He reminds us sometimes of Paul Veronese, and, like that great\\npainter, can crowd, without over-crowding, the giant canvas on which he\\nworks.  We may not at first gain from his works that artistic unity of\\nimpression which is Tourgenieff’s chief charm, but once that we have\\nmastered the details the whole seems to have the grandeur and the\\nsimplicity of an epic.  Dostoieffski differs widely from both his rivals.\\nHe is not so fine an artist as Tourgenieff, for he deals more with the\\nfacts than with the effects of life; nor has he Tolstoi’s largeness of\\nvision and epic dignity; but he has qualities that are distinctively and\\nabsolutely his own, such as a fierce intensity of passion and\\nconcentration of impulse, a power of dealing with the deepest mysteries\\nof psychology and the most hidden springs of life, and a realism that is\\npitiless in its fidelity, and terrible because it is true.  Some time ago\\nwe had occasion to draw attention to his marvellous novel _Crime and\\nPunishment_, where in the haunt of impurity and vice a harlot and an\\nassassin meet together to read the story of Dives and Lazarus, and the\\noutcast girl leads the sinner to make atonement for his sin; nor is the\\nbook entitled _Injury and Insult_ at all inferior to that great\\nmasterpiece.  Mean and ordinary though the surroundings of the story may\\nseem, the heroine Natasha is like one of the noble victims of Greek\\ntragedy; she is Antigone with the passion of Phædra, and it is impossible\\nto approach her without a feeling of awe.  Greek also is the gloom of\\nNemesis that hangs over each character, only it is a Nemesis that does\\nnot stand outside of life, but is part of our own nature and of the same\\nmaterial as life itself.  Aleósha, the beautiful young lad whom Natasha\\nfollows to her doom, is a second Tito Melema, and has all Tito’s charm\\nand grace and fascination.  Yet he is different.  He would never have\\ndenied Baldassare in the Square at Florence, nor lied to Romola about\\nTessa.  He has a magnificent, momentary sincerity, a boyish\\nunconsciousness of all that life signifies, an ardent enthusiasm for all\\nthat life cannot give.  There is nothing calculating about him.  He never\\nthinks evil, he only does it.  From a psychological point of view he is\\none of the most interesting characters of modern fiction, as from an\\nartistic he is one of the most attractive.  As we grow to know him he\\nstirs strange questions for us, and makes us feel that it is not the\\nwicked only who do wrong, nor the bad alone who work evil.\\n\\nAnd by what a subtle objective method does Dostoieffski show us his\\ncharacters!  He never tickets them with a list nor labels them with a\\ndescription.  We grow to know them very gradually, as we know people whom\\nwe meet in society, at first by little tricks of manner, personal\\nappearance, fancies in dress, and the like; and afterwards by their deeds\\nand words; and even then they constantly elude us, for though\\nDostoieffski may lay bare for us the secrets of their nature, yet he\\nnever explains his personages away; they are always surprising us by\\nsomething that they say or do, and keep to the end the eternal mystery of\\nlife.\\n\\nIrrespective of its value as a work of art, this novel possesses a deep\\nautobiographical interest also, as the character of Vania, the poor\\nstudent who loves Natasha through all her sin and shame, is\\nDostoieffski’s study of himself.  Goethe once had to delay the completion\\nof one of his novels till experience had furnished him with new\\nsituations, but almost before he had arrived at manhood Dostoieffski knew\\nlife in its most real forms; poverty and suffering, pain and misery,\\nprison, exile, and love, were soon familiar to him, and by the lips of\\nVania he has told his own story.  This note of personal feeling, this\\nharsh reality of actual experience, undoubtedly gives the book something\\nof its strange fervour and terrible passion, yet it has not made it\\negotistic; we see things from every point of view, and we feel, not that\\nfiction has been trammelled by fact, but that fact itself has become\\nideal and imaginative.  Pitiless, too, though Dostoieffski is in his\\nmethod as an artist, as a man he is full of human pity for all, for those\\nwho do evil as well as for those who suffer it, for the selfish no less\\nthan for those whose lives are wrecked for others and whose sacrifice is\\nin vain.  Since _Adam Bede_ and _Le Père Goriot_ no more powerful novel\\nhas been written than _Insult and Injury_.\\n\\n_Injury and Insult_.  By Fedor Dostoieffski.

PATER’S _IMAGINARY PORTRAITS_\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, June 11, 1887.)\\n\\n\\nTo convey ideas through the medium of images has always been the aim of\\nthose who are artists as well as thinkers in literature, and it is to a\\ndesire to give a sensuous environment to intellectual concepts that we\\nowe Mr. Pater’s last volume.  For these Imaginary or, as we should prefer\\nto call them, Imaginative Portraits of his, form a series of philosophic\\nstudies in which the philosophy is tempered by personality, and the\\nthought shown under varying conditions of mood and manner, the very\\npermanence of each principle gaining something through the change and\\ncolour of the life through which it finds expression.  The most\\nfascinating of all these pictures is undoubtedly that of Sebastian Van\\nStorck.  The account of Watteau is perhaps a little too fanciful, and the\\ndescription of him as one who was ‘always a seeker after something in the\\nworld, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all,’ seems to\\nus more applicable to him who saw Mona Lisa sitting among the rocks than\\nthe gay and debonair _peintre des fêtes galantes_.  But Sebastian, the\\ngrave young Dutch philosopher, is charmingly drawn.  From the first\\nglimpse we get of him, skating over the water-meadows with his plume of\\nsquirrel’s tail and his fur muff, in all the modest pleasantness of\\nboyhood, down to his strange death in the desolate house amid the sands\\nof the Helder, we seem to see him, to know him, almost to hear the low\\nmusic of his voice.  He is a dreamer, as the common phrase goes, and yet\\nhe is poetical in this sense, that his theorems shape life for him,\\ndirectly.  Early in youth he is stirred by a fine saying of Spinoza, and\\nsets himself to realize the ideal of an intellectual disinterestedness,\\nseparating himself more and more from the transient world of sensation,\\naccident and even affection, till what is finite and relative becomes of\\nno interest to him, and he feels that as nature is but a thought of his,\\nso he himself is but a passing thought of God.  This conception, of the\\npower of a mere metaphysical abstraction over the mind of one so\\nfortunately endowed for the reception of the sensible world, is\\nexceedingly delightful, and Mr. Pater has never written a more subtle\\npsychological study, the fact that Sebastian dies in an attempt to save\\nthe life of a little child giving to the whole story a touch of poignant\\npathos and sad irony.\\n\\n_Denys l’Auxerrois_ is suggested by a figure found, or said to be found,\\non some old tapestries in Auxerre, the figure of a ‘flaxen and flowery\\ncreature, sometimes well-nigh naked among the vine-leaves, sometimes\\nmuffled in skins against the cold, sometimes in the dress of a monk, but\\nalways with a strong impress of real character and incident from the\\nveritable streets’ of the town itself.  From this strange design Mr.\\nPater has fashioned a curious mediæval myth of the return of Dionysus\\namong men, a myth steeped in colour and passion and old romance, full of\\nwonder and full of worship, Denys himself being half animal and half god,\\nmaking the world mad with a new ecstasy of living, stirring the artists\\nsimply by his visible presence, drawing the marvel of music from reed and\\npipe, and slain at last in a stage-play by those who had loved him.  In\\nits rich affluence of imagery this story is like a picture by Mantegna,\\nand indeed Mantegna might have suggested the description of the pageant\\nin which Denys rides upon a gaily-painted chariot, in soft silken raiment\\nand, for head-dress, a strange elephant scalp with gilded tusks.\\n\\nIf _Denys l’Auxerrois_ symbolizes the passion of the senses and\\n_Sebastian Van Storck_ the philosophic passion, as they certainly seem to\\ndo, though no mere formula or definition can adequately express the\\nfreedom and variety of the life that they portray, the passion for the\\nimaginative world of art is the basis of the story of _Duke Carl of\\nRosenmold_.  Duke Carl is not unlike the late King of Bavaria, in his\\nlove of France, his admiration for the _Grand Monarque_ and his fantastic\\ndesire to amaze and to bewilder, but the resemblance is possibly only a\\nchance one.  In fact Mr. Pater’s young hero is the precursor of the\\n_Aufklärung_ of the last century, the German precursor of Herder and\\nLessing and Goethe himself, and finds the forms of art ready to his hand\\nwithout any national spirit to fill them or make them vital and\\nresponsive.  He too dies, trampled to death by the soldiers of the\\ncountry he so much admired, on the night of his marriage with a peasant\\ngirl, the very failure of his life lending him a certain melancholy grace\\nand dramatic interest.\\n\\nOn the whole, then, this is a singularly attractive book.  Mr. Pater is\\nan intellectual impressionist.  He does not weary us with any definite\\ndoctrine or seek to suit life to any formal creed.  He is always looking\\nfor exquisite moments and, when he has found them, he analyses them with\\ndelicate and delightful art and then passes on, often to the opposite\\npole of thought or feeling, knowing that every mood has its own quality\\nand charm and is justified by its mere existence.  He has taken the\\nsensationalism of Greek philosophy and made it a new method of art\\ncriticism.  As for his style, it is curiously ascetic.  Now and then, we\\ncome across phrases with a strange sensuousness of expression, as when he\\ntells us how Denys l’Auxerrois, on his return from a long journey, ‘ate\\nflesh for the first time, tearing the hot, red morsels with his delicate\\nfingers in a kind of wild greed,’ but such passages are rare.  Asceticism\\nis the keynote of Mr. Pater’s prose; at times it is almost too severe in\\nits self-control and makes us long for a little more freedom.  For\\nindeed, the danger of such prose as his is that it is apt to become\\nsomewhat laborious.  Here and there, one is tempted to say of Mr. Pater\\nthat he is ‘a seeker after something in language, that is there in no\\nsatisfying measure, or not at all.’  The continual preoccupation with\\nphrase and epithet has its drawbacks as well as its virtues.  And yet,\\nwhen all is said, what wonderful prose it is, with its subtle\\npreferences, its fastidious purity, its rejection of what is common or\\nordinary!  Mr. Pater has the true spirit of selection, the true art of\\nomission.  If he be not among the greatest prose writers of our\\nliterature he is, at least, our greatest artist in prose; and though it\\nmay be admitted that the best style is that which seems an unconscious\\nresult rather than a conscious aim, still in these latter days when\\nviolent rhetoric does duty for eloquence and vulgarity usurps the name of\\nnature, we should be grateful for a style that deliberately aims at\\nperfection of form, that seeks to produce its effect by artistic means\\nand sets before itself an ideal of grave and chastened beauty.\\n\\n_Imaginary Portraits_.  By Walter Pater, M.A., Fellow of Brasenose\\nCollege, Oxford.  (Macmillan and Co.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA GERMAN PRINCESS\\n(_Woman’s World_, November 1887.)\\n\\n\\nThe Princess Christian’s translation of the _Memoirs of Wilhelmine_,\\n_Margravine of Baireuth_, is a most fascinating and delightful book.  The\\nMargravine and her brother, Frederick the Great, were, as the Princess\\nherself points out in an admirably written introduction, ‘among the first\\nof those questioning minds that strove after spiritual freedom’ in the\\nlast century.  ‘They had studied,’ says the Princess, ‘the English\\nphilosophers, Newton, Locke, and Shaftesbury, and were roused to\\nenthusiasm by the writings of Voltaire and Rousseau.  Their whole lives\\nbore the impress of the influence of French thought on the burning\\nquestions of the day.  In the eighteenth century began that great\\nstruggle of philosophy against tyranny and worn-out abuses which\\nculminated in the French Revolution.  The noblest minds were engaged in\\nthe struggle, and, like most reformers, they pushed their conclusions to\\nextremes, and too often lost sight of the need of a due proportion in\\nthings.  The Margravine’s influence on the intellectual development of\\nher country is untold.  She formed at Baireuth a centre of culture and\\nlearning which had before been undreamt of in Germany.’\\n\\nThe historical value of these _Memoirs_ is, of course, well known.\\nCarlyle speaks of them as being ‘by far the best authority’ on the early\\nlife of Frederick the Great.  But considered merely as the autobiography\\nof a clever and charming woman, they are no less interesting, and even\\nthose who care nothing for eighteenth-century politics, and look upon\\nhistory itself as an unattractive form of fiction, cannot fail to be\\nfascinated by the Margravine’s wit, vivacity and humour, by her keen\\npowers of observation, and by her brilliant and assertive egotism.  Not\\nthat her life was by any means a happy one.  Her father, to quote the\\nPrincess Christian, ‘ruled his family with the same harsh despotism with\\nwhich he ruled his country, taking pleasure in making his power felt by\\nall in the most galling manner,’ and the Margravine and her brother ‘had\\nmuch to suffer, not only from his ungovernable temper, but also from the\\nreal privations to which they were subjected.’  Indeed, the picture the\\nMargravine gives of the King is quite extraordinary.  ‘He despised all\\nlearning,’ she writes, ‘and wished me to occupy myself with nothing but\\nneedlework and household duties or details.  Had he found me writing or\\nreading, he would probably have whipped me.’  He ‘considered music a\\ncapital offence, and maintained that every one should devote himself to\\none object: men to the military service, and women to their household\\nduties.  Science and the arts he counted among the “seven deadly sins.”’\\nSometimes he took to religion, ‘and then,’ says the Margravine, ‘we lived\\nlike trappists, to the great grief of my brother and myself.  Every\\nafternoon the King preached a sermon, to which we had to listen as\\nattentively as if it proceeded from an Apostle.  My brother and I were\\noften seized with such an intense sense of the ridiculous that we burst\\nout laughing, upon which an apostolic curse was poured out on our heads,\\nwhich we had to accept with a show of humility and penitence.’  Economy\\nand soldiers were his only topics of conversation; his chief social\\namusement was to make his guests intoxicated; and as for his temper, the\\naccounts the Margravine gives of it would be almost incredible if they\\nwere not amply corroborated from other sources.  Suetonius has written of\\nthe strange madness that comes on kings, but even in his melodramatic\\nchronicles there is hardly anything that rivals what the Margravine has\\nto tell us.  Here is one of her pictures of family life at a Royal Court\\nin the last century, and it is not by any means the worst scene she\\ndescribes:\\n\\n    On one occasion, when his temper was more than usually bad, he told\\n    the Queen that he had received letters from Anspach, in which the\\n    Margrave announced his arrival at Berlin for the beginning of May.\\n    He was coming there for the purpose of marrying my sister, and one of\\n    his ministers would arrive previously with the betrothal ring.  My\\n    father asked my sister whether she were pleased at this prospect, and\\n    how she would arrange her household.  Now my sister had always made a\\n    point of telling him whatever came into her head, even the greatest\\n    home-truths, and he had never taken her outspokenness amiss.  On this\\n    occasion, therefore, relying on former experience, she answered him\\n    as follows: ‘When I have a house of my own, I shall take care to have\\n    a well-appointed dinner-table, better than yours is, and if I have\\n    children of my own, I shall not plague them as you do yours, and\\n    force them to eat things they thoroughly dislike!’\\n\\n    ‘What is amiss with my dinner-table?’ the King enquired, getting very\\n    red in the face.\\n\\n    ‘You ask what is the matter with it,’ my sister replied; ‘there is\\n    not enough on it for us to eat, and what there is is cabbage and\\n    carrots, which we detest.’  Her first answer had already angered my\\n    father, but now he gave vent to his fury.  But instead of punishing\\n    my sister he poured it all on my mother, my brother, and myself.  To\\n    begin with he threw his plate at my brother’s head, who would have\\n    been struck had he not got out of the way; a second one he threw at\\n    me, which I also happily escaped; then torrents of abuse followed\\n    these first signs of hostility.  He reproached the Queen with having\\n    brought up her children so badly.  ‘You will curse your mother,’ he\\n    said to my brother, ‘for having made you such a good-for-nothing\\n    creature.’ . . . As my brother and I passed near him to leave the\\n    room, he hit out at us with his crutch.  Happily we escaped the blow,\\n    for it would certainly have struck us down, and we at last escaped\\n    without harm.\\n\\nYet, as the Princess Christian remarks, ‘despite the almost cruel\\ntreatment Wilhelmine received from her father, it is noticeable that\\nthroughout her memoirs she speaks of him with the greatest affection.\\nShe makes constant reference to his “good heart”’; and says that his\\nfaults ‘were more those of temper than of nature.’  Nor could all the\\nmisery and wretchedness of her home life dull the brightness of her\\nintellect.  What would have made others morbid, made her satirical.\\nInstead of weeping over her own personal tragedies, she laughs at the\\ngeneral comedy of life.  Here, for instance, is her description of Peter\\nthe Great and his wife, who arrived at Berlin in 1718:\\n\\n    The Czarina was small, broad, and brown-looking, without the\\n    slightest dignity or appearance.  You had only to look at her to\\n    detect her low origin.  She might have passed for a German actress,\\n    she had decked herself out in such a manner.  Her dress had been\\n    bought second-hand, and was trimmed with some dirty looking silver\\n    embroidery; the bodice was trimmed with precious stones, arranged in\\n    such a manner as to represent the double eagle.  She wore a dozen\\n    orders; and round the bottom of her dress hung quantities of relics\\n    and pictures of saints, which rattled when she walked, and reminded\\n    one of a smartly harnessed mule.  The orders too made a great noise,\\n    knocking against each other.\\n\\n    The Czar, on the other hand, was tall and well grown, with a handsome\\n    face, but his expression was coarse, and impressed one with fear.  He\\n    wore a simple sailor’s dress.  His wife, who spoke German very badly,\\n    called her court jester to her aid, and spoke Russian with her.  This\\n    poor creature was a Princess Gallizin, who had been obliged to\\n    undertake this sorry office to save her life, as she had been mixed\\n    up in a conspiracy against the Czar, and had twice been flogged with\\n    the knout!\\n\\n                                  * * * * *\\n\\n    The following day [the Czar] visited all the sights of Berlin,\\n    amongst others the very curious collection of coins and antiques.\\n    Amongst these last named was a statue, representing a heathen god.\\n    It was anything but attractive, but was the most valuable in the\\n    collection.  The Czar admired it very much, and insisted on the\\n    Czarina kissing it.  On her refusing, he said to her in bad German\\n    that she should lose her head if she did not at once obey him.  Being\\n    terrified at the Czar’s anger she immediately complied with his\\n    orders without the least hesitation.  The Czar asked the King to give\\n    him this and other statues, a request which he could not refuse.  The\\n    same thing happened about a cupboard, inlaid with amber.  It was the\\n    only one of its kind, and had cost King Frederick I. an enormous sum,\\n    and the consternation was general on its having to be sent to\\n    Petersburg.\\n\\n    This barbarous Court happily left after two days.  The Queen rushed\\n    at once to Monbijou, which she found in a state resembling that of\\n    the fall of Jerusalem.  I never saw such a sight.  Everything was\\n    destroyed, so that the Queen was obliged to rebuild the whole house.\\n\\nNor are the Margravine’s descriptions of her reception as a bride in the\\nprincipality of Baireuth less amusing.  Hof was the first town she came\\nto, and a deputation of nobles was waiting there to welcome her.  This is\\nher account of them:\\n\\n    Their faces would have frightened little children, and, to add to\\n    their beauty, they had arranged their hair to resemble the wigs that\\n    were then in fashion.  Their dresses clearly denoted the antiquity of\\n    their families, as they were composed of heirlooms, and were cut\\n    accordingly, so that most of them did not fit.  In spite of their\\n    costumes being the ‘Court Dresses,’ the gold and silver trimmings\\n    were so black that you had a difficulty in making out of what they\\n    were made.  The manners of these nobles suited their faces and their\\n    clothes.  They might have passed for peasants.  I could scarcely\\n    restrain my laughter when I first beheld these strange figures.  I\\n    spoke to each in turn, but none of them understood what I said, and\\n    their replies sounded to me like Hebrew, because the dialect of the\\n    Empire is quite different from that spoken in Brandenburg.\\n\\n    The clergy also presented themselves.  These were totally different\\n    creatures.  Round their necks they wore great ruffs, which resembled\\n    washing baskets.  They spoke very slowly, so that I might be able to\\n    understand them better.  They said the most foolish things, and it\\n    was only with much difficulty that I was able to prevent myself from\\n    laughing.  At last I got rid of all these people, and we sat down to\\n    dinner.  I tried my best to converse with those at table, but it was\\n    useless.  At last I touched on agricultural topics, and then they\\n    began to thaw.  I was at once informed of all their different\\n    farmsteads and herds of cattle.  An almost interesting discussion\\n    took place as to whether the oxen in the upper part of the country\\n    were fatter than those in the lowlands.\\n\\n                                  * * * * *\\n\\n    I was told that as the next day was Sunday, I must spend it at Hof,\\n    and listen to a sermon.  Never before had I heard such a sermon!  The\\n    clergyman began by giving us an account of all the marriages that had\\n    taken place from Adam’s time to that of Noah.  We were spared no\\n    detail, so that the gentlemen all laughed and the poor ladies\\n    blushed.  The dinner went off as on the previous day.  In the\\n    afternoon all the ladies came to pay me their respects.  Gracious\\n    heavens!  What ladies, too!  They were all as ugly as the gentlemen,\\n    and their head-dresses were so curious that swallows might have built\\n    their nests in them.\\n\\nAs for Baireuth itself, and its petty Court, the picture she gives of it\\nis exceedingly curious.  Her father-in-law, the reigning Margrave, was a\\nnarrow-minded mediocrity, whose conversation ‘resembled that of a sermon\\nread aloud for the purpose of sending the listener to sleep,’ and he had\\nonly two topics, Telemachus, and Amelot de la Houssaye’s _Roman History_.\\nThe Ministers, from Baron von Stein, who always said ‘yes’ to everything,\\nto Baron von Voit, who always said ‘no,’ were not by any means an\\nintellectual set of men.  ‘Their chief amusement,’ says the Margravine,\\n‘was drinking from morning till night,’ and horses and cattle were all\\nthey talked about.  The palace itself was shabby, decayed and dirty.  ‘I\\nwas like a lamb among wolves,’ cries the poor Margravine; ‘I was settled\\nin a strange country, at a Court which more resembled a peasant’s farm,\\nsurrounded by coarse, bad, dangerous, and tiresome people.’\\n\\nYet her _esprit_ never deserted her.  She is always clever, witty, and\\nentertaining.  Her stories about the endless squabbles over precedence\\nare extremely amusing.  The society of her day cared very little for good\\nmanners, knew, indeed, very little about them, but all questions of\\netiquette were of vital importance, and the Margravine herself, though\\nshe saw the shallowness of the whole system, was far too proud not to\\nassert her rights when circumstances demanded it, as the description she\\ngives of her visit to the Empress of Germany shows very clearly.  When\\nthis meeting was first proposed, the Margravine declined positively to\\nentertain the idea.  ‘There was no precedent,’ she writes, ‘of a King’s\\ndaughter and the Empress having met, and I did not know to what rights I\\nought to lay claim.’  Finally, however, she is induced to consent, but\\nshe lays down three conditions for her reception:\\n\\n    I desired first of all that the Empress’s Court should receive me at\\n    the foot of the stairs, secondly, that she should meet me at the door\\n    of her bedroom, and, thirdly, that she should offer me an armchair to\\n    sit on.\\n\\n                                  * * * * *\\n\\n    They disputed all day over the conditions I had made.  The two first\\n    were granted me, but all that could be obtained with respect to the\\n    third was, that the Empress would use quite a small armchair, whilst\\n    she gave me a chair.\\n\\n    Next day I saw this Royal personage.  I own that had I been in her\\n    place I would have made all the rules of etiquette and ceremony the\\n    excuse for not being obliged to appear.  The Empress was small and\\n    stout, round as a ball, very ugly, and without dignity or manner.\\n    Her mind corresponded to her body.  She was terribly bigoted, and\\n    spent her whole day praying.  The old and ugly are generally the\\n    Almighty’s portion.  She received me trembling all over, and was so\\n    upset that she could not say a word.\\n\\n    After some silence I began the conversation in French.  She answered\\n    me in her Austrian dialect that she could not speak in that language,\\n    and begged I would speak in German.  The conversation did not last\\n    long, for the Austrian and low Saxon tongues are so different from\\n    each other that to those acquainted with only one the other is\\n    unintelligible.  This is what happened to us.  A third person would\\n    have laughed at our misunderstandings, for we caught only a word here\\n    and there, and had to guess the rest.  The poor Empress was such a\\n    slave to etiquette that she would have thought it high treason had\\n    she spoken to me in a foreign language, though she understood French\\n    quite well.\\n\\nMany other extracts might be given from this delightful book, but from\\nthe few that have been selected some idea can be formed of the vivacity\\nand picturesqueness of the Margravine’s style.  As for her character, it\\nis very well summed up by the Princess Christian, who, while admitting\\nthat she often appears almost heartless and inconsiderate, yet claims\\nthat, ‘taken as a whole, she stands out in marked prominence among the\\nmost gifted women of the eighteenth century, not only by her mental\\npowers, but by her goodness of heart, her self-sacrificing devotion, and\\ntrue friendship.’  An interesting sequel to her _Memoirs_ would be her\\ncorrespondence with Voltaire, and it is to be hoped that we may shortly\\nsee a translation of these letters from the same accomplished pen to\\nwhich we owe the present volume. {63}\\n\\n_Memoirs of Wilhelmine Margravine of Baireuth_.  Translated and edited by\\nHer Royal Highness Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, Princess of\\nGreat Britain and Ireland.  (David Stott.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA VILLAGE TRAGEDY\\n\\n\\nOne of the most powerful and pathetic novels that has recently appeared\\nis _A Village Tragedy_ by Margaret L. Woods.  To find any parallel to\\nthis lurid little story, one must go to Dostoieffski or to Guy de\\nMaupassant.  Not that Mrs. Woods can be said to have taken either of\\nthese two great masters of fiction as her model, but there is something\\nin her work that recalls their method; she has not a little of their\\nfierce intensity, their terrible concentration, their passionless yet\\npoignant objectivity; like them, she seems to allow life to suggest its\\nown mode of presentation; and, like them, she recognizes that a frank\\nacceptance of the facts of life is the true basis of all modern imitative\\nart.  The scene of Mrs. Woods’s story lies in one of the villages near\\nOxford; the characters are very few in number, and the plot is extremely\\nsimple.  It is a romance of modern Arcadia—a tale of the love of a\\nfarm-labourer for a girl who, though slightly above him in social station\\nand education, is yet herself also a servant on a farm.  True Arcadians\\nthey are, both of them, and their ignorance and isolation serve only to\\nintensify the tragedy that gives the story its title.  It is the fashion\\nnowadays to label literature, so, no doubt, Mrs. Woods’s novel will be\\nspoken of as ‘realistic.’  Its realism, however, is the realism of the\\nartist, not of the reporter; its tact of treatment, subtlety of\\nperception, and fine distinction of style, make it rather a poem than a\\n_procès-verbal_; and though it lays bare to us the mere misery of life,\\nit suggests something of life’s mystery also.  Very delicate, too, is the\\nhandling of external Nature.  There are no formal guide-book descriptions\\nof scenery, nor anything of what Byron petulantly called ‘twaddling about\\ntrees,’ but we seem to breathe the atmosphere of the country, to catch\\nthe exquisite scent of the beanfields, so familiar to all who have ever\\nwandered through the Oxfordshire lanes in June; to hear the birds singing\\nin the thicket, and the sheep-bells tinkling from the hill.\\n\\nCharacterization, that enemy of literary form, is such an essential part\\nof the method of the modern writer of fiction, that Nature has almost\\nbecome to the novelist what light and shade are to the painter—the one\\npermanent element of style; and if the power of _A Village Tragedy_ be\\ndue to its portrayal of human life, no small portion of its charm comes\\nfrom its Theocritean setting.\\n\\n_A Village Tragedy_.  By Margaret L. Woods.  (Bentley and Son.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMR. MORRIS’S COMPLETION OF THE _ODYSSEY_\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, November 24, 1887.)\\n\\n\\nMr. Morris’s second volume brings the great romantic epic of Greek\\nliterature to its perfect conclusion, and although there can never be an\\nultimate translation of either _Iliad_ or _Odyssey_, as each successive\\nage is sure to find pleasure in rendering the two poems in its own manner\\nand according to its own canons of taste, still it is not too much to say\\nthat Mr. Morris’s version will always be a true classic amongst our\\nclassical translations.  It is not, of course, flawless.  In our notice\\nof the first volume we ventured to say that Mr. Morris was sometimes far\\nmore Norse than Greek, nor does the volume that now lies before us make\\nus alter that opinion.  The particular metre, also, selected by Mr.\\nMorris, although admirably adapted to express ‘the strong-winged music of\\nHomer,’ as far as its flow and freedom are concerned, misses something of\\nits dignity and calm.  Here, it must be admitted, we feel a distinct\\nloss, for there is in Homer not a little of Milton’s lofty manner, and if\\nswiftness be an essential of the Greek hexameter, stateliness is one of\\nits distinguishing qualities in Homer’s hands.  This defect, however, if\\nwe must call it a defect, seems almost unavoidable, as for certain\\nmetrical reasons a majestic movement in English verse is necessarily a\\nslow movement; and, after all that can be said is said, how really\\nadmirable is this whole translation!  If we set aside its noble qualities\\nas a poem and look on it purely from the scholar’s point of view, how\\nstraightforward it is, how honest and direct!  Its fidelity to the\\noriginal is far beyond that of any other verse-translation in our\\nliterature, and yet it is not the fidelity of a pedant to his text but\\nrather the fine loyalty of poet to poet.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Morris’s first volume appeared many of the critics complained\\nthat his occasional use of archaic words and unusual expressions robbed\\nhis version of the true Homeric simplicity.  This, however, is not a very\\nfelicitous criticism, for while Homer is undoubtedly simple in his\\nclearness and largeness of vision, his wonderful power of direct\\nnarration, his wholesome sanity, and the purity and precision of his\\nmethod, simple in language he undoubtedly is not.  What he was to his\\ncontemporaries we have, of course, no means of judging, but we know that\\nthe Athenian of the fifth century B.C. found him in many places difficult\\nto understand, and when the creative age was succeeded by the age of\\ncriticism and Alexandria began to take the place of Athens as the centre\\nof culture for the Hellenistic world, Homeric dictionaries and glossaries\\nseem to have been constantly published.  Indeed, Athenæus tells us of a\\nwonderful Byzantine blue-stocking, a _précieuse_ from the Propontis, who\\nwrote a long hexameter poem, called _Mnemosyne_, full of ingenious\\ncommentaries on difficulties in Homer, and in fact, it is evident that,\\nas far as the language is concerned, such a phrase as ‘Homeric\\nsimplicity’ would have rather amazed an ancient Greek.  As for Mr.\\nMorris’s tendency to emphasize the etymological meaning of words, a point\\ncommented on with somewhat flippant severity in a recent number of\\n_Macmillan_’_s Magazine_, here Mr. Morris seems to us to be in complete\\naccord, not merely with the spirit of Homer, but with the spirit of all\\nearly poetry.  It is quite true that language is apt to degenerate into a\\nsystem of almost algebraic symbols, and the modern city-man who takes a\\nticket for Blackfriars Bridge, naturally never thinks of the Dominican\\nmonks who once had their monastery by Thames-side, and after whom the\\nspot is named.  But in earlier times it was not so.  Men were then keenly\\nconscious of the real meaning of words, and early poetry, especially, is\\nfull of this feeling, and, indeed, may be said to owe to it no small\\nportion of its poetic power and charm.  These old words, then, and this\\nold use of words which we find in Mr. Morris’s _Odyssey_ can be amply\\njustified upon historical grounds, and as for their artistic effect, it\\nis quite excellent.  Pope tried to put Homer into the ordinary language\\nof his day, with what result we know only too well; but Mr. Morris, who\\nuses his archaisms with the tact of a true artist, and to whom indeed\\nthey seem to come absolutely naturally, has succeeded in giving to his\\nversion by their aid that touch, not of ‘quaintness,’ for Homer is never\\nquaint, but of old-world romance and old-world beauty, which we moderns\\nfind so pleasurable, and to which the Greeks themselves were so keenly\\nsensitive.\\n\\nAs for individual passages of special merit, Mr. Morris’s translation is\\nno robe of rags sewn with purple patches for critics to sample.  Its real\\nvalue lies in the absolute rightness and coherence of the whole, in the\\ngrand architecture of the swift, strong verse, and in the fact that the\\nstandard is not merely high but everywhere sustained.  It is impossible,\\nhowever, to resist the temptation of quoting Mr. Morris’s rendering of\\nthat famous passage in the twenty-third book of the epic, in which\\nOdysseus eludes the trap laid for him by Penelope, whose very faith in\\nthe certainty of her husband’s return makes her sceptical of his identity\\nwhen he stands before her; an instance, by the way, of Homer’s wonderful\\npsychological knowledge of human nature, as it is always the dreamer\\nhimself who is most surprised when his dream comes true.\\n\\n    Thus she spake to prove her husband; but Odysseus, grieved at heart,\\n    Spake thus unto his bed-mate well-skilled in gainful art:\\n    ‘O woman, thou sayest a word exceeding grievous to me!\\n    Who hath otherwhere shifted my bedstead? full hard for him should it\\n    be,\\n    For as deft as he were, unless soothly a very God come here,\\n    Who easily, if he willed it, might shift it otherwhere.\\n    But no mortal man is living, how strong soe’er in his youth,\\n    Who shall lightly hale it elsewhere, since a mighty wonder forsooth\\n    Is wrought in that fashioned bedstead, and I wrought it, and I alone.\\n    In the close grew a thicket of olive, a long-leaved tree full-grown,\\n    That flourished and grew goodly as big as a pillar about,\\n    So round it I built my bride-room, till I did the work right out\\n    With ashlar stone close-fitting; and I roofed it overhead,\\n    And thereto joined doors I made me, well-fitting in their stead.\\n    Then I lopped away the boughs of the long-leafed olive-tree,\\n    And, shearing the bole from the root up full well and cunningly,\\n    I planed it about with the brass, and set the rule thereto,\\n    And shaping thereof a bed-post, with the wimble I bored it through.\\n    So beginning, I wrought out the bedstead, and finished it utterly,\\n    And with gold enwrought it about, and with silver and ivory,\\n    And stretched on it a thong of oxhide with the purple dye made\\n    bright.\\n    Thus then the sign I have shown thee; nor, woman, know I aright\\n    If my bed yet bideth steadfast, or if to another place\\n    Some man hath moved it, and smitten the olive-bole from its base.’\\n\\nThese last twelve books of the _Odyssey_ have not the same marvel of\\nromance, adventure and colour that we find in the earlier part of the\\nepic.  There is nothing in them that we can compare to the exquisite\\nidyll of Nausicaa or to the Titanic humour of the episode in the Cyclops’\\ncave.  Penelope has not the glamour of Circe, and the song of the Sirens\\nmay sound sweeter than the whizz of the arrows of Odysseus as he stands\\non the threshold of his hall.  Yet, for sheer intensity of passionate\\npower, for concentration of intellectual interest and for masterly\\ndramatic construction, these latter books are quite unequalled.  Indeed,\\nthey show very clearly how it was that, as Greek art developed, the epos\\npassed into the drama.  The whole scheme of the argument, the return of\\nthe hero in disguise, his disclosure of himself to his son, his terrible\\nvengeance on his enemies and his final recognition by his wife, reminds\\nus of the plot of more than one Greek play, and shows us what the great\\nAthenian poet meant when he said that his own dramas were merely scraps\\nfrom Homer’s table.  In rendering this splendid poem into English verse,\\nMr. Morris has done our literature a service that can hardly be\\nover-estimated, and it is pleasant to think that, even should the\\nclassics be entirely excluded from our educational systems, the English\\nboy will still be able to know something of Homer’s delightful tales, to\\ncatch an echo of his grand music and to wander with the wise Odysseus\\nround ‘the shores of old romance.’\\n\\n_The Odyssey of Homer_.  Done into English Verse by William Morris,\\nAuthor of _The Earthly Paradise_.  Volume II.  (Reeves and Turner.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMRS. SOMERVILLE\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, November 30, 1887.)\\n\\n\\nPhyllis Browne’s Life of Mrs. Somerville forms part of a very interesting\\nlittle series, called ‘The World’s Workers’—a collection of short\\nbiographies catholic enough to include personalities so widely different\\nas Turner and Richard Cobden, Handel and Sir Titus Salt, Robert\\nStephenson and Florence Nightingale, and yet possessing a certain\\ndefinite aim.  As a mathematician and a scientist, the translator and\\npopularizer of _La Mécanique Céleste_, and the author of an important\\nbook on physical geography, Mrs. Somerville is, of course, well known.\\nThe scientific bodies of Europe covered her with honours; her bust stands\\nin the hall of the Royal Society, and one of the Women’s Colleges at\\nOxford bears her name.  Yet, considered simply in the light of a wife and\\na mother, she is no less admirable; and those who consider that stupidity\\nis the proper basis for the domestic virtues, and that intellectual women\\nmust of necessity be helpless with their hands, cannot do better than\\nread Phyllis Browne’s pleasant little book, in which they will find that\\nthe greatest woman-mathematician of any age was a clever needlewoman, a\\ngood housekeeper, and a most skilful cook.  Indeed, Mrs. Somerville seems\\nto have been quite renowned for her cookery.  The discoverers of the\\nNorth-West Passage christened an island ‘Somerville,’ not as a tribute to\\nthe distinguished mathematician, but as a recognition of the excellence\\nof some orange marmalade which the distinguished mathematician had\\nprepared with her own hands and presented to the ships before they left\\nEngland; and to the fact that she was able to make currant jelly at a\\nvery critical moment she owed the affection of some of her husband’s\\nrelatives, who up to that time had been rather prejudiced against her on\\nthe ground that she was merely an unpractical Blue-stocking.\\n\\nNor did her scientific knowledge ever warp or dull the tenderness and\\nhumanity of her nature.  For birds and animals she had always a great\\nlove.  We hear of her as a little girl watching with eager eyes the\\nswallows as they built their nests in summer or prepared for their flight\\nin the autumn; and when snow was on the ground she used to open the\\nwindows to let the robins hop in and pick crumbs on the breakfast-table.\\nOn one occasion she went with her father on a tour in the Highlands, and\\nfound on her return that a pet goldfinch, which had been left in the\\ncharge of the servants, had been neglected by them and had died of\\nstarvation.  She was almost heart-broken at the event, and in writing her\\n_Recollections_, seventy years after, she mentioned it and said that, as\\nshe wrote, she felt deep pain.  Her chief pet in her old age was a\\nmountain sparrow, which used to perch on her arm and go to sleep there\\nwhile she was writing.  One day the sparrow fell into the water-jug and\\nwas drowned, to the great grief of its mistress who could hardly be\\nconsoled for its loss, though later on we hear of a beautiful paroquet\\ntaking the place of _le moineau d’Uranie_, and becoming Mrs. Somerville’s\\nconstant companion.  She was also very energetic, Phyllis Browne tells\\nus, in trying to get a law passed in the Italian Parliament for the\\nprotection of animals, and said once, with reference to this subject, ‘We\\nEnglish cannot boast of humanity so long as our sportsmen find pleasure\\nin shooting down tame pigeons as they fly terrified out of a cage’—a\\nremark with which I entirely agree.  Mr. Herbert’s Bill for the\\nprotection of land birds gave her immense pleasure, though, to quote her\\nown words, she was ‘grieved to find that “the lark, which at heaven’s\\ngate sings,” is thought unworthy of man’s protection’; and she took a\\ngreat fancy to a gentleman who, on being told of the number of singing\\nbirds that is eaten in Italy—nightingales, goldfinches, and\\nrobins—exclaimed in horror, ‘What! robins! our household birds!  I would\\nas soon eat a child!’  Indeed, she believed to some extent in the\\nimmortality of animals on the ground that, if animals have no future, it\\nwould seem as if some were created for uncompensated misery—an idea which\\ndoes not seem to me to be either extravagant or fantastic, though it must\\nbe admitted that the optimism on which it is based receives absolutely no\\nsupport from science.\\n\\nOn the whole, Phyllis Browne’s book is very pleasant reading.  Its only\\nfault is that it is far too short, and this is a fault so rare in modern\\nliterature that it almost amounts to a distinction.  However, Phyllis\\nBrowne has managed to crowd into the narrow limits at her disposal a\\ngreat many interesting anecdotes.  The picture she gives of Mrs.\\nSomerville working away at her translation of Laplace in the same room\\nwith her children is very charming, and reminds one of what is told of\\nGeorge Sand; there is an amusing account of Mrs. Somerville’s visit to\\nthe widow of the young Pretender, the Countess of Albany, who, after\\ntalking with her for some time, exclaimed, ‘So you don’t speak Italian.\\nYou must have had a very bad education’!  And this story about the\\nWaverley Novels may possibly be new to some of my readers:\\n\\n    A very amusing circumstance in connection with Mrs. Somerville’s\\n    acquaintance with Sir Walter arose out of the childish\\n    inquisitiveness of Woronzow Greig, Mrs. Somerville’s little boy.\\n\\n    During the time Mrs. Somerville was visiting Abbotsford the Waverley\\n    Novels were appearing, and were creating a great sensation; yet even\\n    Scott’s intimate friends did not know that he was the author; he\\n    enjoyed keeping the affair a mystery.  But little Woronzow discovered\\n    what he was about.  One day when Mrs. Somerville was talking about a\\n    novel that had just been published, Woronzow said, ‘I knew all these\\n    stories long ago, for Mr. Scott writes on the dinner-table; when he\\n    has finished he puts the green cloth with the papers in a corner of\\n    the dining-room, and when he goes out Charlie Scott and I read the\\n    stories.’\\n\\nPhyllis Browne remarks that this incident shows ‘that persons who want to\\nkeep a secret ought to be very careful when children are about’; but the\\nstory seems to me to be far too charming to require any moral of the\\nkind.\\n\\nBound up in the same volume is a Life of Miss Mary Carpenter, also\\nwritten by Phyllis Browne.  Miss Carpenter does not seem to me to have\\nthe charm and fascination of Mrs. Somerville.  There is always something\\nabout her that is formal, limited, and precise.  When she was about two\\nyears old she insisted on being called ‘Doctor Carpenter’ in the nursery;\\nat the age of twelve she is described by a friend as a sedate little\\ngirl, who always spoke like a book; and before she entered on her\\neducational schemes she wrote down a solemn dedication of herself to the\\nservice of humanity.  However, she was one of the practical, hardworking\\nsaints of the nineteenth century, and it is no doubt quite right that the\\nsaints should take themselves very seriously.  It is only fair also to\\nremember that her work of rescue and reformation was carried on under\\ngreat difficulties.  Here, for instance, is the picture Miss Cobbe gives\\nus of one of the Bristol night-schools:\\n\\n    It was a wonderful spectacle to see Mary Carpenter sitting patiently\\n    before the large school gallery in St. James’s Back, teaching,\\n    singing, and praying with the wild street-boys, in spite of endless\\n    interruptions caused by such proceedings as shooting marbles at any\\n    object behind her, whistling, stamping, fighting, shrieking out\\n    ‘Amen’ in the middle of a prayer, and sometimes rising _en masse_ and\\n    tearing like a troop of bisons in hob-nailed shoes down from the\\n    gallery, round the great schoolroom, and down the stairs, and into\\n    the street.  These irrepressible outbreaks she bore with infinite\\n    good humour.\\n\\nHer own account is somewhat pleasanter, and shows that ‘the troop of\\nbisons in hob-nailed shoes’ was not always so barbarous.\\n\\n    I had taken to my class on the preceding week some specimens of ferns\\n    neatly gummed on white paper. . . . This time I took a piece of\\n    coal-shale, with impressions of ferns, to show them. . . . I told\\n    each to examine the specimen, and tell me what he thought it was.  W.\\n    gave so bright a smile that I saw he knew; none of the others could\\n    tell; he said they were ferns, like what I showed them last week, but\\n    he thought they were chiselled on the stone.  Their surprise and\\n    pleasure were great when I explained the matter to them.\\n\\n    The history of Joseph: they all found a difficulty in realizing that\\n    this had actually occurred.  One asked if Egypt existed now, and if\\n    people lived in it.  When I told them that buildings now stood which\\n    had been erected about the time of Joseph, one said that it was\\n    impossible, as they must have fallen down ere this.  I showed them\\n    the form of a pyramid, and they were satisfied.  One asked if _all_\\n    books were true.\\n\\n    The story of Macbeth impressed them very much.  They knew the name of\\n    Shakespeare, having seen his name over a public-house.\\n\\nA boy defined conscience as ‘a thing a gentleman hasn’t got, who, when a\\nboy finds his purse and gives it back to him, doesn’t give the boy\\nsixpence.’\\n\\nAnother boy was asked, after a Sunday evening lecture on ‘Thankfulness,’\\nwhat pleasure he enjoyed most in the course of a year.  He replied\\ncandidly, ‘Cock-fightin’, ma’am; there’s a pit up by the “Black Boy” as\\nis worth anythink in Brissel.’\\n\\nThere is something a little pathetic in the attempt to civilize the rough\\nstreet-boy by means of the refining influence of ferns and fossils, and\\nit is difficult to help feeling that Miss Carpenter rather over-estimated\\nthe value of elementary education.  The poor are not to be fed upon\\nfacts.  Even Shakespeare and the Pyramids are not sufficient; nor is\\nthere much use in giving them the results of culture, unless we also give\\nthem those conditions under which culture can be realized.  In these\\ncold, crowded cities of the North, the proper basis for morals, using the\\nword in its wide Hellenic signification, is to be found in architecture,\\nnot in books.\\n\\nStill, it would be ungenerous not to recognize that Mary Carpenter gave\\nto the children of the poor not merely her learning, but her love.  In\\nearly life, her biographer tells us, she had longed for the happiness of\\nbeing a wife and a mother; but later she became content that her\\naffection could be freely given to all who needed it, and the verse in\\nthe prophecies, ‘I have given thee children whom thou hast not borne,’\\nseemed to her to indicate what was to be her true mission.  Indeed, she\\nrather inclined to Bacon’s opinion, that unmarried people do the best\\npublic work.  ‘It is quite striking,’ she says in one of her letters, ‘to\\nobserve how much the useful power and influence of woman has developed of\\nlate years.  Unattached ladies, such as widows and unmarried women, have\\nquite ample work to do in the world for the good of others to absorb all\\ntheir powers.  Wives and mothers have a very noble work given them by\\nGod, and want no more.’  The whole passage is extremely interesting, and\\nthe phrase ‘unattached ladies’ is quite delightful, and reminds one of\\nCharles Lamb.\\n\\n_Mrs. Somerville_ and _Mary Carpenter_.  By Phyllis Browne, Author of\\n_What Girls Can Do_, _etc._  (Cassell and Co.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARISTOTLE AT AFTERNOON TEA\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, December 16, 1887.)\\n\\n\\nIn society, says Mr. Mahaffy, every civilized man and woman ought to feel\\nit their duty to say something, even when there is hardly anything to be\\nsaid, and, in order to encourage this delightful art of brilliant\\nchatter, he has published a social guide without which no _débutante_ or\\ndandy should ever dream of going out to dine.  Not that Mr. Mahaffy’s\\nbook can be said to be, in any sense of the word, popular.  In discussing\\nthis important subject of conversation, he has not merely followed the\\nscientific method of Aristotle which is, perhaps, excusable, but he has\\nadopted the literary style of Aristotle for which no excuse is possible.\\nThere is, also, hardly a single anecdote, hardly a single illustration,\\nand the reader is left to put the Professor’s abstract rules into\\npractice, without either the examples or the warnings of history to\\nencourage or to dissuade him in his reckless career.  Still, the book can\\nbe warmly recommended to all who propose to substitute the vice of\\nverbosity for the stupidity of silence.  It fascinates in spite of its\\nform and pleases in spite of its pedantry, and is the nearest approach,\\nthat we know of, in modern literature to meeting Aristotle at an\\nafternoon tea.\\n\\nAs regards physical conditions, the only one that is considered by Mr.\\nMahaffy as being absolutely essential to a good conversationalist, is the\\npossession of a musical voice.  Some learned writers have been of opinion\\nthat a slight stammer often gives peculiar zest to conversation, but Mr.\\nMahaffy rejects this view and is extremely severe on every eccentricity\\nfrom a native brogue to an artificial catchword.  With his remarks on the\\nlatter point, the meaningless repetition of phrases, we entirely agree.\\nNothing can be more irritating than the scientific person who is always\\nsaying ‘_Exactly so_,’ or the commonplace person who ends every sentence\\nwith ‘_Don’t you know_?’ or the pseudo-artistic person who murmurs\\n‘_Charming_, _charming_,’ on the smallest-provocation.  It is, however,\\nwith the mental and moral qualifications for conversation that Mr.\\nMahaffy specially deals.  Knowledge he, naturally, regards as an absolute\\nessential, for, as he most justly observes, ‘an ignorant man is seldom\\nagreeable, except as a butt.’  Upon the other hand, strict accuracy\\nshould be avoided.  ‘Even a consummate liar,’ says Mr. Mahaffy, is a\\nbetter ingredient in a company than ‘the scrupulously truthful man, who\\nweighs every statement, questions every fact, and corrects every\\ninaccuracy.’  The liar at any rate recognizes that recreation, not\\ninstruction, is the aim of conversation, and is a far more civilized\\nbeing than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story\\nwhich is told simply for the amusement of the company.  Mr. Mahaffy,\\nhowever, makes an exception in favour of the eminent specialist and tells\\nus that intelligent questions addressed to an astronomer, or a pure\\nmathematician, will elicit many curious facts which will pleasantly\\nbeguile the time.  Here, in the interest of Society, we feel bound to\\nenter a formal protest.  Nobody, even in the provinces, should ever be\\nallowed to ask an intelligent question about pure mathematics across a\\ndinner-table.  A question of this kind is quite as bad as inquiring\\nsuddenly about the state of a man’s soul, a sort of _coup_ which, as Mr.\\nMahaffy remarks elsewhere, ‘many pious people have actually thought a\\ndecent introduction to a conversation.’\\n\\nAs for the moral qualifications of a good talker, Mr. Mahaffy, following\\nthe example of his great master, warns us against any disproportionate\\nexcess of virtue.  Modesty, for instance, may easily become a social\\nvice, and to be continually apologizing for one’s ignorance or stupidity\\nis a grave injury to conversation, for, ‘what we want to learn from each\\nmember is his free opinion on the subject in hand, not his own estimate\\nof the value of that opinion.’  Simplicity, too, is not without its\\ndangers.  The _enfant terrible_, with his shameless love of truth, the\\nraw country-bred girl who always says what she means, and the plain,\\nblunt man who makes a point of speaking his mind on every possible\\noccasion, without ever considering whether he has a mind at all, are the\\nfatal examples of what simplicity leads to.  Shyness may be a form of\\nvanity, and reserve a development of pride, and as for sympathy, what can\\nbe more detestable than the man, or woman, who insists on agreeing with\\neverybody, and so makes ‘a discussion, which implies differences in\\nopinion,’ absolutely impossible?  Even the unselfish listener is apt to\\nbecome a bore.  ‘These silent people,’ says Mr. Mahaffy, ‘not only take\\nall they can get in Society for nothing, but they take it without the\\nsmallest gratitude, and have the audacity afterwards to censure those who\\nhave laboured for their amusement.’  Tact, which is an exquisite sense of\\nthe symmetry of things, is, according to Mr. Mahaffy, the highest and\\nbest of all the moral conditions for conversation.  The man of tact, he\\nmost wisely remarks, ‘will instinctively avoid jokes about Blue Beard’ in\\nthe company of a woman who is a man’s third wife; he will never be guilty\\nof talking like a book, but will rather avoid too careful an attention to\\ngrammar and the rounding of periods; he will cultivate the art of\\ngraceful interruption, so as to prevent a subject being worn threadbare\\nby the aged or the inexperienced; and should he be desirous of telling a\\nstory, he will look round and consider each member of the party, and if\\nthere be a single stranger present will forgo the pleasure of anecdotage\\nrather than make the social mistake of hurting even one of the guests.\\nAs for prepared or premeditated art, Mr. Mahaffy has a great contempt for\\nit and tells us of a certain college don (let us hope not at Oxford or\\nCambridge) who always carried a jest-book in his pocket and had to refer\\nto it when he wished to make a repartee.  Great wits, too, are often very\\ncruel, and great humorists often very vulgar, so it will be better to try\\nand ‘make good conversation without any large help from these brilliant\\nbut dangerous gifts.’\\n\\nIn a _tête-à-tête_ one should talk about persons, and in general Society\\nabout things.  The state of the weather is always an excusable exordium,\\nbut it is convenient to have a paradox or heresy on the subject always\\nready so as to direct the conversation into other channels.  Really\\ndomestic people are almost invariably bad talkers as their very virtues\\nin home life have dulled their interest in outer things.  The very best\\nmothers will insist on chattering of their babies and prattling about\\ninfant education.  In fact, most women do not take sufficient interest in\\npolitics, just as most men are deficient in general reading.  Still,\\nanybody can be made to talk, except the very obstinate, and even a\\ncommercial traveller may be drawn out and become quite interesting.  As\\nfor Society small talk, it is impossible, Mr. Mahaffy tells us, for any\\nsound theory of conversation to depreciate gossip, ‘which is perhaps the\\nmain factor in agreeable talk throughout Society.’  The retailing of\\nsmall personal points about great people always gives pleasure, and if\\none is not fortunate enough to be an Arctic traveller or an escaped\\nNihilist, the best thing one can do is to relate some anecdote of ‘Prince\\nBismarck, or King Victor Emmanuel, or Mr. Gladstone.’  In the case of\\nmeeting a genius and a Duke at dinner, the good talker will try to raise\\nhimself to the level of the former and to bring the latter down to his\\nown level.  To succeed among one’s social superiors one must have no\\nhesitation in contradicting them.  Indeed, one should make bold\\ncriticisms and introduce a bright and free tone into a Society whose\\ngrandeur and extreme respectability make it, Mr. Mahaffy remarks, as\\npathetically as inaccurately, ‘perhaps somewhat dull.’  The best\\nconversationalists are those whose ancestors have been bilingual, like\\nthe French and Irish, but the art of conversation is really within the\\nreach of almost every one, except those who are morbidly truthful, or\\nwhose high moral worth requires to be sustained by a permanent gravity of\\ndemeanour and a general dullness of mind.\\n\\nThese are the broad principles contained in Mr. Mahaffy’s clever little\\nbook, and many of them will, no doubt, commend themselves to our readers.\\nThe maxim, ‘If you find the company dull, blame yourself,’ seems to us\\nsomewhat optimistic, and we have no sympathy at all with the professional\\nstoryteller who is really a great bore at a dinner-table; but Mr. Mahaffy\\nis quite right in insisting that no bright social intercourse is possible\\nwithout equality, and it is no objection to his book to say that it will\\nnot teach people how to talk cleverly.  It is not logic that makes men\\nreasonable, nor the science of ethics that makes men good, but it is\\nalways useful to analyse, to formularize and to investigate.  The only\\nthing to be regretted in the volume is the arid and jejune character of\\nthe style.  If Mr. Mahaffy would only write as he talks, his book would\\nbe much pleasanter reading.\\n\\n_The Principles of the Art of Conversation_: _A Social Essay_.  By J. P.\\nMahaffy.

There is, of course, nothing particularly original in\\nMiss Stokes’s book, nor can she be said to be a very attractive or\\npleasing writer, but it is unfair to look for originality in primers, and\\nthe charm of the illustrations fully atones for the somewhat heavy and\\npedantic character of the style.\\n\\nThis early Christian art of Ireland is full of interest to the artist,\\nthe archæologist and the historian.  In its rudest forms, such as the\\nlittle iron hand-bell, the plain stone chalice and the rough wooden\\nstaff, it brings us back to the simplicity of the primitive Christian\\nChurch, while to the period of its highest development we owe the great\\nmasterpieces of Celtic metal-work.  The stone chalice is now replaced by\\nthe chalice of silver and gold; the iron bell has its jewel-studded\\nshrine, and the rough staff its gorgeous casing; rich caskets and\\nsplendid bindings preserve the holy books of the Saints and, instead of\\nthe rudely carved symbol of the early missionaries, we have such\\nbeautiful works of art as the processional cross of Cong Abbey.\\nBeautiful this cross certainly is with its delicate intricacy of\\nornamentation, its grace of proportion and its marvel of mere\\nworkmanship, nor is there any doubt about its history.  From the\\ninscriptions on it, which are corroborated by the annals of Innisfallen\\nand the book of Clonmacnoise, we learn that it was made for King Turlough\\nO’Connor by a native artist under the superintendence of Bishop O’Duffy,\\nits primary object being to enshrine a portion of the true cross that was\\nsent to the king in 1123.  Brought to Cong some years afterwards,\\nprobably by the archbishop, who died there in 1150, it was concealed at\\nthe time of the Reformation, but at the beginning of the present century\\nwas still in the possession of the last abbot, and at his death it was\\npurchased by Professor MacCullagh and presented by him to the museum of\\nthe Royal Irish Academy.  This wonderful work is alone well worth a visit\\nto Dublin, but not less lovely is the chalice of Ardagh, a two-handled\\nsilver cup, absolutely classical in its perfect purity of form, and\\ndecorated with gold and amber and crystal and with varieties of\\n_cloisonné_ and _champlevé_ enamel.  There is no mention of this cup, or\\nof the so-called Tara brooch, in ancient Irish history.  All that we know\\nof them is that they were found accidentally, the former by a boy who was\\ndigging potatoes near the old Rath of Ardagh, the latter by a poor child\\nwho picked it up near the seashore.  They both, however, belong probably\\nto the tenth century.\\n\\nOf all these works, as well as of the bell shrines, book-covers,\\nsculptured crosses and illuminated designs in manuscripts, excellent\\npictures are given in Miss Stokes’s handbook.  The extremely interesting\\n_Fiachal Phadrig_, or shrine of St. Patrick’s tooth, might have been\\nfigured and noted as an interesting example of the survival of ornament,\\nand one of the old miniatures of the scribe or Evangelist writing would\\nhave given an additional interest to the chapter on Irish MSS.  On the\\nwhole, however, the book is wonderfully well illustrated, and the\\nordinary art student will be able to get some useful suggestions from it.\\nIndeed, Miss Stokes, echoing the aspirations of many of the great Irish\\narchæologists, looks forward to the revival of a native Irish school in\\narchitecture, sculpture, metal-work and painting.  Such an aspiration is,\\nof course, very laudable, but there is always a danger of these revivals\\nbeing merely artificial reproductions, and it may be questioned whether\\nthe peculiar forms of Irish ornamentation could be made at all expressive\\nof the modern spirit.  A recent writer on house decoration has gravely\\nsuggested that the British householder should take his meals in a Celtic\\ndining-room adorned with a dado of Ogham inscriptions, and such wicked\\nproposals may serve as a warning to all who fancy that the reproduction\\nof a form necessarily implies a revival of the spirit that gave the form\\nlife and meaning, and who fail to recognize the difference between art\\nand anachronisms.  Miss Stokes’s proposal for an ark-shaped church in\\nwhich the mural painter is to repeat the arcades and ‘follow the\\narchitectural compositions of the grand pages of the Eusebian canons in\\nthe Book of Kells,’ has, of course, nothing grotesque about it, but it is\\nnot probable that the artistic genius of the Irish people will, even when\\n‘the land has rest,’ find in such interesting imitations its healthiest\\nor best expression.  Still, there are certain elements of beauty in\\nancient Irish art that the modern artist would do well to study.  The\\nvalue of the intricate illuminations in the Book of Kells, as far as\\ntheir adaptability to modern designs and modern material goes, has been\\nvery much overrated, but in the ancient Irish torques, brooches, pins,\\nclasps and the like, the modern goldsmith will find a rich and,\\ncomparatively speaking, an untouched field; and now that the Celtic\\nspirit has become the leaven of our politics, there is no reason why it\\nshould not contribute something to our decorative art.  This result,\\nhowever, will not be obtained by a patriotic misuse of old designs, and\\neven the most enthusiastic Home Ruler must not be allowed to decorate his\\ndining-room with a dado of Oghams.\\n\\n_Early Christian Art in Ireland_.  By Margaret Stokes.  (Published for\\nthe Committee of Council on Education by Chapman and Hall.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMADAME RISTORI\\n(_Woman’s World_, January 1888.)\\n\\n\\nMadame Ristori’s _Etudes et Souvenirs_ is one of the most delightful\\nbooks on the stage that has appeared since Lady Martin’s charming volume\\non the Shakespearian heroines.  It is often said that actors leave\\nnothing behind them but a barren name and a withered wreath; that they\\nsubsist simply upon the applause of the moment; that they are ultimately\\ndoomed to the oblivion of old play-bills; and that their art, in a word,\\ndies with them, and shares their own mortality.  ‘Chippendale, the\\ncabinet-maker,’ says the clever author of _Obiter Dicta_, ‘is more potent\\nthan Garrick the actor.  The vivacity of the latter no longer charms\\n(save in Boswell); the chairs of the former still render rest impossible\\nin a hundred homes.’  This view, however, seems to me to be exaggerated.\\nIt rests on the assumption that acting is simply a mimetic art, and takes\\nno account of its imaginative and intellectual basis.  It is quite true,\\nof course, that the personality of the player passes away, and with it\\nthat pleasure-giving power by virtue of which the arts exist.  Yet the\\nartistic method of a great actor survives.  It lives on in tradition, and\\nbecomes part of the science of a school.  It has all the intellectual\\nlife of a principle.  In England, at the present moment, the influence of\\nGarrick on our actors is far stronger than that of Reynolds on our\\npainters of portraits, and if we turn to France it is easy to discern the\\ntradition of Talma, but where is the tradition of David?\\n\\nMadame Ristori’s memoirs, then, have not merely the charm that always\\nattaches to the autobiography of a brilliant and beautiful woman, but\\nhave also a definite and distinct artistic value.  Her analysis of the\\ncharacter of Lady Macbeth, for instance, is full of psychological\\ninterest, and shows us that the subtleties of Shakespearian criticism are\\nnot necessarily confined to those who have views on weak endings and\\nrhyming tags, but may also be suggested by the art of acting itself.  The\\nauthor of _Obiter Dicta_ seeks to deny to actors all critical insight and\\nall literary appreciation.  The actor, he tells us, is art’s slave, not\\nher child, and lives entirely outside literature, ‘with its words for\\never on his lips, and none of its truths engraven on his heart.’  But\\nthis seems to me to be a harsh and reckless generalization.  Indeed, so\\nfar from agreeing with it, I would be inclined to say that the mere\\nartistic process of acting, the translation of literature back again into\\nlife, and the presentation of thought under the conditions of action, is\\nin itself a critical method of a very high order; nor do I think that a\\nstudy of the careers of our great English actors will really sustain the\\ncharge of want of literary appreciation.  It may be true that actors pass\\ntoo quickly away from the form, in order to get at the feeling that gives\\nthe form beauty and colour, and that, where the literary critic studies\\nthe language, the actor looks simply for the life; and yet, how well the\\ngreat actors have appreciated that marvellous music of words, which in\\nShakespeare, at any rate, is so vital an element of poetic power, if,\\nindeed, it be not equally so in the case of all who have any claim to be\\nregarded as true poets.  ‘The sensual life of verse,’ says Keats, in a\\ndramatic criticism published in the _Champion_, ‘springs warm from the\\nlips of Kean, and to one learned in Shakespearian hieroglyphics, learned\\nin the spiritual portion of those lines to which Kean adds a sensual\\ngrandeur, his tongue must seem to have robbed the Hybla bees and left\\nthem honeyless.’  This particular feeling, of which Keats speaks, is\\nfamiliar to all who have heard Salvini, Sarah Bernhardt, Ristori, or any\\nof the great artists of our day, and it is a feeling that one cannot, I\\nthink, gain merely by reading the passage to oneself.  For my own part, I\\nmust confess that it was not until I heard Sarah Bernhardt in _Phèdre_\\nthat I absolutely realized the sweetness of the music of Racine.  As for\\nMr. Birrell’s statement that actors have the words of literature for ever\\non their lips, but none of its truths engraved on their hearts, all that\\none can say is that, if it be true, it is a defect which actors share\\nwith the majority of literary critics.\\n\\nThe account Madame Ristori gives of her own struggles, voyages and\\nadventures, is very pleasant reading indeed.  The child of poor actors,\\nshe made her first appearance when she was three months old, being\\nbrought on in a hamper as a New Year’s gift to a selfish old gentleman\\nwho would not forgive his daughter for having married for love.  As,\\nhowever, she began to cry long before the hamper was opened, the comedy\\nbecame a farce, to the immense amusement of the public.  She next\\nappeared in a mediæval melodrama, being then three years of age, and was\\nso terrified at the machinations of the villain that she ran away at the\\nmost critical moment.  However, her stage-fright seems to have\\ndisappeared, and we find her playing Silvio Pellico’s _Francesca da\\nRimini_ at fifteen, and at eighteen making her _début_ as Marie Stuart.\\nAt this time the naturalism of the French method was gradually displacing\\nthe artificial elocution and academic poses of the Italian school of\\nacting.  Madame Ristori seems to have tried to combine simplicity with\\nstyle, and the passion of nature with the self-restraint of the artist.\\n‘J’ai voulu fondre les deux manières,’ she tells us, ‘car je sentais que\\ntoutes choses étant susceptibles de progrès, l’art dramatique aussi était\\nappelé à subir des transformations.’  The natural development, however,\\nof the Italian drama was almost arrested by the ridiculous censorship of\\nplays then existing in each town under Austrian or Papal rule.  The\\nslightest allusion to the sentiment of nationality or the spirit of\\nfreedom was prohibited.  Even the word _patria_ was regarded as\\ntreasonable, and Madame Ristori tells us an amusing story of the\\nindignation of a censor who was asked to license a play, in which a dumb\\nman returns home after an absence of many years, and on his entrance upon\\nthe stage makes gestures expressive of his joy in seeing his native land\\nonce more.  ‘Gestures of this kind,’ said the censor, ‘are obviously of a\\nvery revolutionary tendency, and cannot possibly be allowed.  The only\\ngestures that I could think of permitting would be gestures expressive of\\na dumb man’s delight in scenery generally.’  The stage directions were\\naccordingly altered, and the word ‘landscape’ substituted for ‘native\\nland’!  Another censor was extremely severe on an unfortunate poet who\\nhad used the expression ‘the beautiful Italian sky,’ and explained to him\\nthat ‘the beautiful Lombardo-Venetian sky’ was the proper official\\nexpression to use.  Poor Gregory in _Romeo and Juliet_ had to be\\nrechristened, because Gregory is a name dear to the Popes; and the\\n\\n    Here I have a pilot’s thumb,\\n    Wrecked as homeward he did come,\\n\\nof the first witch in _Macbeth_ was ruthlessly struck out as containing\\nan obvious allusion to the steersman of St. Peter’s bark.  Finally, bored\\nand bothered by the political and theological Dogberrys of the day, with\\ntheir inane prejudices, their solemn stupidity, and their entire\\nignorance of the conditions necessary for the growth of sane and healthy\\nart, Madame Ristori made up her mind to leave the stage.  She, however,\\nwas extremely anxious to appear once before a Parisian audience, Paris\\nbeing at that time the centre of dramatic activity, and after some\\nconsideration left Italy for France in the year 1855.  There she seems to\\nhave been a great success, particularly in the part of Myrrha; classical\\nwithout being cold, artistic without being academic, she brought to the\\ninterpretation of the character of Alfieri’s great heroine the\\ncolour-element of passion, the form-element of style.  Jules Janin was\\nloud in his praises, the Emperor begged Ristori to join the troupe of the\\nComédie Française, and Rachel, with the strange narrow jealousy of her\\nnature, trembled for her laurels.  Myrrha was followed by Marie Stuart,\\nand Marie Stuart by Medea.  In the latter part Madame Ristori excited the\\ngreatest enthusiasm.  Ary Scheffer designed her costumes for her; and the\\nNiobe that stands in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence, suggested to Madame\\nRistori her famous pose in the scene with the children.  She would not\\nconsent, however, to remain in France, and we find her subsequently\\nplaying in almost every country in the world from Egypt to Mexico, from\\nDenmark to Honolulu.  Her representations of classical plays seem to have\\nbeen always immensely admired.  When she played at Athens, the King\\noffered to arrange for a performance in the beautiful old theatre of\\nDionysos, and during her tour in Portugal she produced _Medea_ before the\\nUniversity of Coimbra.  Her description of the latter engagement is\\nextremely interesting.  On her arrival at the University, she was\\nreceived by the entire body of the undergraduates, who still wear a\\ncostume almost mediæval in character.  Some of them came on the stage in\\nthe course of the play as the handmaidens of Creusa, hiding their black\\nbeards beneath heavy veils, and as soon as they had finished their parts\\nthey took their places gravely among the audience, to Madame Ristori’s\\nhorror, still in their Greek dress, but with their veils thrown back and\\nsmoking long cigars.  ‘Ce n’est pas la première fois,’ she says, ‘que\\nj’ai dû empêcher, par un effort de volonté, la tragédie de se terminer en\\nfarce.’  Very interesting, also, is her account of the production of\\nMontanelli’s _Camma_, and she tells an amusing story of the arrest of the\\nauthor by the French police on the charge of murder, in consequence of a\\ntelegram she sent to him in which the words ‘body of the victim’\\noccurred.  Indeed, the whole book is full of cleverly written stories,\\nand admirable criticisms on dramatic art.  I have quoted from the French\\nversion, which happens to be the one that lies before me, but whether in\\nFrench or Italian the book is one of the most fascinating autobiographies\\nthat has appeared for some time, even in an age like ours when literary\\negotism has been brought to such an exquisite pitch of perfection.\\n\\n_Etudes et Souvenirs_.  By Madame Ristori.  (Paul Ollendorff.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nENGLISH POETESSES\\n(_Queen_, December 8, 1888.)\\n\\n\\nEngland has given to the world one great poetess, Elizabeth Barrett\\nBrowning.  By her side Mr. Swinburne would place Miss Christina Rossetti,\\nwhose New Year hymn he describes as so much the noblest of sacred poems\\nin our language, that there is none which comes near it enough to stand\\nsecond.  ‘It is a hymn,’ he tells us, ‘touched as with the fire, and\\nbathed as in the light of sunbeams, tuned as to chords and cadences of\\nrefluent sea-music beyond reach of harp and organ, large echoes of the\\nserene and sonorous tides of heaven.’  Much as I admire Miss Rossetti’s\\nwork, her subtle choice of words, her rich imagery, her artistic naïveté,\\nwherein curious notes of strangeness and simplicity are fantastically\\nblended together, I cannot but think that Mr. Swinburne has, with noble\\nand natural loyalty, placed her on too lofty a pedestal.  To me, she is\\nsimply a very delightful artist in poetry.  This is indeed something so\\nrare that when we meet it we cannot fail to love it, but it is not\\neverything.  Beyond it and above it are higher and more sunlit heights of\\nsong, a larger vision, and an ampler air, a music at once more passionate\\nand more profound, a creative energy that is born of the spirit, a winged\\nrapture that is born of the soul, a force and fervour of mere utterance\\nthat has all the wonder of the prophet, and not a little of the\\nconsecration of the priest.\\n\\nMrs. Browning is unapproachable by any woman who has ever touched lyre or\\nblown through reed since the days of the great Æolian poetess.  But\\nSappho, who to the antique world was a pillar of flame, is to us but a\\npillar of shadow.  Of her poems, burnt with other most precious work by\\nByzantine Emperor and by Roman Pope, only a few fragments remain.\\nPossibly they lie mouldering in the scented darkness of an Egyptian tomb,\\nclasped in the withered hand of some long-dead lover.  Some Greek monk at\\nAthos may even now be poring over an ancient manuscript, whose crabbed\\ncharacters conceal lyric or ode by her whom the Greeks spoke of as ‘the\\nPoetess’ just as they termed Homer ‘the Poet,’ who was to them the tenth\\nMuse, the flower of the Graces, the child of Erôs, and the pride of\\nHellas—Sappho, with the sweet voice, the bright, beautiful eyes, the dark\\nhyacinth coloured hair.  But, practically, the work of the marvellous\\nsinger of Lesbos is entirely lost to us.\\n\\nWe have a few rose-leaves out of her garden, that is all.  Literature\\nnowadays survives marble and bronze, but in the old days, in spite of the\\nRoman poet’s noble boast, it was not so.  The fragile clay vases of the\\nGreeks still keep for us pictures of Sappho, delicately painted in black\\nand red and white; but of her song we have only the echo of an echo.\\n\\nOf all the women of history, Mrs. Browning is the only one that we could\\nname in any possible or remote conjunction with Sappho.\\n\\nSappho was undoubtedly a far more flawless and perfect artist.  She\\nstirred the whole antique world more than Mrs. Browning ever stirred our\\nmodern age.  Never had Love such a singer.  Even in the few lines that\\nremain to us the passion seems to scorch and burn.  But, as unjust Time,\\nwho has crowned her with the barren laurels of fame, has twined with them\\nthe dull poppies of oblivion, let us turn from the mere memory of a\\npoetess to one whose song still remains to us as an imperishable glory to\\nour literature; to her who heard the cry of the children from dark mine\\nand crowded factory, and made England weep over its little ones; who, in\\nthe feigned sonnets from the Portuguese, sang of the spiritual mystery of\\nLove, and of the intellectual gifts that Love brings to the soul; who had\\nfaith in all that is worthy, and enthusiasm for all that is great, and\\npity for all that suffers; who wrote the _Vision of Poets_ and _Casa\\nGuidi Windows_ and _Aurora Leigh_.\\n\\nAs one, to whom I owe my love of poetry no less than my love of country,\\nsaid of her:\\n\\n             Still on our ears\\n    The clear ‘Excelsior’ from a woman’s lip\\n    Rings out across the Apennines, although\\n    The woman’s brow lies pale and cold in death\\n    With all the mighty marble dead in Florence.\\n    For while great songs can stir the hearts of men,\\n    Spreading their full vibrations through the world\\n    In ever-widening circles till they reach\\n    The Throne of God, and song becomes a prayer,\\n    And prayer brings down the liberating strength\\n    That kindles nations to heroic deeds,\\n    She lives—the great-souled poetess who saw\\n    From Casa Guidi windows Freedom dawn\\n    On Italy, and gave the glory back\\n    In sunrise hymns to all Humanity!\\n\\nShe lives indeed, and not alone in the heart of Shakespeare’s England,\\nbut in the heart of Dante’s Italy also.  To Greek literature she owed her\\nscholarly culture, but modern Italy created her human passion for\\nLiberty.  When she crossed the Alps she became filled with a new ardour,\\nand from that fine, eloquent mouth, that we can still see in her\\nportraits, broke forth such a noble and majestic outburst of lyrical song\\nas had not been heard from woman’s lips for more than two thousand years.\\nIt is pleasant to think that an English poetess was to a certain extent a\\nreal factor in bringing about that unity of Italy that was Dante’s dream,\\nand if Florence drove her great singer into exile, she at least welcomed\\nwithin her walls the later singer that England had sent to her.\\n\\nIf one were asked the chief qualities of Mrs. Browning’s work, one would\\nsay, as Mr. Swinburne said of Byron’s, its sincerity and its strength.\\nFaults it, of course, possesses.  ‘She would rhyme moon to table,’ used\\nto be said of her in jest; and certainly no more monstrous rhymes are to\\nbe found in all literature than some of those we come across in Mrs.\\nBrowning’s poems.  But her ruggedness was never the result of\\ncarelessness.  It was deliberate, as her letters to Mr. Horne show very\\nclearly.  She refused to sandpaper her muse.  She disliked facile\\nsmoothness and artificial polish.  In her very rejection of art she was\\nan artist.  She intended to produce a certain effect by certain means,\\nand she succeeded; and her indifference to complete assonance in rhyme\\noften gives a splendid richness to her verse, and brings into it a\\npleasurable element of surprise.\\n\\nIn philosophy she was a Platonist, in politics an Opportunist.  She\\nattached herself to no particular party.  She loved the people when they\\nwere king-like, and kings when they showed themselves to be men.  Of the\\nreal value and motive of poetry she had a most exalted idea.  ‘Poetry,’\\nshe says, in the preface of one of her volumes, ‘has been as serious a\\nthing to me as life itself; and life has been a very serious thing.\\nThere has been no playing at skittles for me in either.  I never mistook\\npleasure for the final cause of poetry, nor leisure for the hour of the\\npoet.  I have done my work so far, not as mere hand and head work apart\\nfrom the personal being, but as the completest expression of that being\\nto which I could attain.’\\n\\nIt certainly is her completest expression, and through it she realizes\\nher fullest perfection.  ‘The poet,’ she says elsewhere, ‘is at once\\nricher and poorer than he used to be; he wears better broadcloth, but\\nspeaks no more oracles.’  These words give us the keynote to her view of\\nthe poet’s mission.  He was to utter Divine oracles, to be at once\\ninspired prophet and holy priest; and as such we may, I think, without\\nexaggeration, conceive her.  She was a Sibyl delivering a message to the\\nworld, sometimes through stammering lips, and once at least with blinded\\neyes, yet always with the true fire and fervour of lofty and unshaken\\nfaith, always with the great raptures of a spiritual nature, the high\\nardours of an impassioned soul.  As we read her best poems we feel that,\\nthough Apollo’s shrine be empty and the bronze tripod overthrown, and the\\nvale of Delphi desolate, still the Pythia is not dead.  In our own age\\nshe has sung for us, and this land gave her new birth.  Indeed, Mrs.\\nBrowning is the wisest of the Sibyls, wiser even than that mighty figure\\nwhom Michael Angelo has painted on the roof of the Sistine Chapel at\\nRome, poring over the scroll of mystery, and trying to decipher the\\nsecrets of Fate; for she realized that, while knowledge is power,\\nsuffering is part of knowledge.\\n\\nTo her influence, almost as much as to the higher education of women, I\\nwould be inclined to attribute the really remarkable awakening of woman’s\\nsong that characterizes the latter half of our century in England.  No\\ncountry has ever had so many poetesses at once.  Indeed, when one\\nremembers that the Greeks had only nine muses, one is sometimes apt to\\nfancy that we have too many.  And yet the work done by women in the\\nsphere of poetry is really of a very high standard of excellence.  In\\nEngland we have always been prone to underrate the value of tradition in\\nliterature.  In our eagerness to find a new voice and a fresh mode of\\nmusic, we have forgotten how beautiful Echo may be.  We look first for\\nindividuality and personality, and these are, indeed, the chief\\ncharacteristics of the masterpieces of our literature, either in prose or\\nverse; but deliberate culture and a study of the best models, if united\\nto an artistic temperament and a nature susceptible of exquisite\\nimpressions, may produce much that is admirable, much that is worthy of\\npraise.  It would be quite impossible to give a complete catalogue of all\\nthe women who since Mrs. Browning’s day have tried lute and lyre.  Mrs.\\nPfeiffer, Mrs. Hamilton King, Mrs. Augusta Webster, Graham Tomson, Miss\\nMary Robinson, Jean Ingelow, Miss May Kendall, Miss Nesbit, Miss May\\nProbyn, Mrs. Craik, Mrs. Meynell, Miss Chapman, and many others have done\\nreally good work in poetry, either in the grave Dorian mode of thoughtful\\nand intellectual verse, or in the light and graceful forms of old French\\nsong, or in the romantic manner of antique ballad, or in that ‘moment’s\\nmonument,’ as Rossetti called it, the intense and concentrated sonnet.\\nOccasionally one is tempted to wish that the quick, artistic faculty that\\nwomen undoubtedly possess developed itself somewhat more in prose and\\nsomewhat less in verse.  Poetry is for our highest moods, when we wish to\\nbe with the gods, and in our poetry nothing but the very best should\\nsatisfy us; but prose is for our daily bread, and the lack of good prose\\nis one of the chief blots on our culture.  French prose, even in the\\nhands of the most ordinary writers, is always readable, but English prose\\nis detestable.  We have a few, a very few, masters, such as they are.  We\\nhave Carlyle, who should not be imitated; and Mr. Pater, who, through the\\nsubtle perfection of his form, is inimitable absolutely; and Mr. Froude,\\nwho is useful; and Matthew Arnold, who is a model; and Mr. George\\nMeredith, who is a warning; and Mr. Lang, who is the divine amateur; and\\nMr. Stevenson, who is the humane artist; and Mr. Ruskin, whose rhythm and\\ncolour and fine rhetoric and marvellous music of words are entirely\\nunattainable.  But the general prose that one reads in magazines and in\\nnewspapers is terribly dull and cumbrous, heavy in movement and uncouth\\nor exaggerated in expression.  Possibly some day our women of letters\\nwill apply themselves more definitely to prose.\\n\\nTheir light touch, and exquisite ear, and delicate sense of balance and\\nproportion would be of no small service to us.  I can fancy women\\nbringing a new manner into our literature.\\n\\nHowever, we have to deal here with women as poetesses, and it is\\ninteresting to note that, though Mrs. Browning’s influence undoubtedly\\ncontributed very largely to the development of this new song-movement, if\\nI may so term it, still there seems to have been never a time during the\\nlast three hundred years when the women of this kingdom did not\\ncultivate, if not the art, at least the habit, of writing poetry.\\n\\nWho the first English poetess was I cannot say.  I believe it was the\\nAbbess Juliana Berners, who lived in the fifteenth century; but I have no\\ndoubt that Mr. Freeman would be able at a moment’s notice to produce some\\nwonderful Saxon or Norman poetess, whose works cannot be read without a\\nglossary, and even with its aid are completely unintelligible.  For my\\nown part, I am content with the Abbess Juliana, who wrote\\nenthusiastically about hawking; and after her I would mention Anne Askew,\\nwho in prison and on the eve of her fiery martyrdom wrote a ballad that\\nhas, at any rate, a pathetic and historical interest.  Queen Elizabeth’s\\n‘most sweet and sententious ditty’ on Mary Stuart is highly praised by\\nPuttenham, a contemporary critic, as an example of ‘Exargasia, or the\\nGorgeous in Literature,’ which somehow seems a very suitable epithet for\\nsuch a great Queen’s poems.  The term she applies to the unfortunate\\nQueen of Scots, ‘the daughter of debate,’ has, of course, long since\\npassed into literature.  The Countess of Pembroke, Sir Philip Sidney’s\\nsister, was much admired as a poetess in her day.\\n\\nIn 1613 the ‘learned, virtuous, and truly noble ladie,’ Elizabeth Carew,\\npublished a _Tragedie of Marian_, _the Faire Queene of Jewry_, and a few\\nyears later the ‘noble ladie Diana Primrose’ wrote _A Chain of Pearl_,\\nwhich is a panegyric on the ‘peerless graces’ of Gloriana.  Mary Morpeth,\\nthe friend and admirer of Drummond of Hawthornden; Lady Mary Wroth, to\\nwhom Ben Jonson dedicated _The Alchemist_; and the Princess Elizabeth,\\nthe sister of Charles I., should also be mentioned.\\n\\nAfter the Restoration women applied themselves with still greater ardour\\nto the study of literature and the practice of poetry.  Margaret, Duchess\\nof Newcastle, was a true woman of letters, and some of her verses are\\nextremely pretty and graceful.  Mrs. Aphra Behn was the first\\nEnglishwoman who adopted literature as a regular profession.  Mrs.\\nKatharine Philips, according to Mr. Gosse, invented sentimentality.  As\\nshe was praised by Dryden, and mourned by Cowley, let us hope she may be\\nforgiven.  Keats came across her poems at Oxford when he was writing\\n_Endymion_, and found in one of them ‘a most delicate fancy of the\\nFletcher kind’; but I fear nobody reads the Matchless Orinda now.  Of\\nLady Winchelsea’s _Nocturnal Reverie_ Wordsworth said that, with the\\nexception of Pope’s _Windsor Forest_, it was the only poem of the period\\nintervening between _Paradise Lost_ and Thomson’s _Seasons_ that\\ncontained a single new image of external nature.  Lady Rachel Russell,\\nwho may be said to have inaugurated the letter-writing literature of\\nEngland; Eliza Haywood, who is immortalized by the badness of her work,\\nand has a niche in _The Dunciad_; and the Marchioness of Wharton, whose\\npoems Waller said he admired, are very remarkable types, the finest of\\nthem being, of course, the first named, who was a woman of heroic mould\\nand of a most noble dignity of nature.\\n\\nIndeed, though the English poetesses up to the time of Mrs. Browning\\ncannot be said to have produced any work of absolute genius, they are\\ncertainly interesting figures, fascinating subjects for study.  Amongst\\nthem we find Lady Mary Wortley Montague, who had all the caprice of\\nCleopatra, and whose letters are delightful reading; Mrs. Centlivre, who\\nwrote one brilliant comedy; Lady Anne Barnard, whose _Auld Robin Gray_\\nwas described by Sir Walter Scott as ‘worth all the dialogues Corydon and\\nPhillis have together spoken from the days of Theocritus downwards,’ and\\nis certainly a very beautiful and touching poem; Esther Vanhomrigh and\\nHester Johnson, the Vanessa and the Stella of Dean Swift’s life; Mrs.\\nThrale, the friend of the great lexicographer; the worthy Mrs. Barbauld;\\nthe excellent Miss Hannah More; the industrious Joanna Baillie; the\\nadmirable Mrs. Chapone, whose _Ode to Solitude_ always fills me with the\\nwildest passion for society, and who will at least be remembered as the\\npatroness of the establishment at which Becky Sharp was educated; Miss\\nAnna Seward, who was called ‘The Swan of Lichfield’; poor L. E. L. whom\\nDisraeli described in one of his clever letters to his sister as ‘the\\npersonification of Brompton—pink satin dress, white satin shoes, red\\ncheeks, snub nose, and her hair _à la_ Sappho’; Mrs. Ratcliffe, who\\nintroduced the romantic novel, and has consequently much to answer for;\\nthe beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, of whom Gibbon said that she was\\n‘made for something better than a Duchess’; the two wonderful sisters,\\nLady Dufferin and Mrs. Norton; Mrs. Tighe, whose _Psyche_ Keats read with\\npleasure; Constantia Grierson, a marvellous blue-stocking in her time;\\nMrs. Hemans; pretty, charming ‘Perdita,’ who flirted alternately with\\npoetry and the Prince Regent, played divinely in the _Winter’s Tale_, was\\nbrutally attacked by Gifford, and has left us a pathetic little poem on a\\nSnowdrop; and Emily Brontë, whose poems are instinct with tragic power,\\nand seem often on the verge of being great.\\n\\nOld fashions in literature are not so pleasant as old fashions in dress.\\nI like the costume of the age of powder better than the poetry of the age\\nof Pope.  But if one adopts the historical standpoint—and this is,\\nindeed, the only standpoint from which we can ever form a fair estimate\\nof work that is not absolutely of the highest order—we cannot fail to see\\nthat many of the English poetesses who preceded Mrs. Browning were women\\nof no ordinary talent, and that if the majority of them looked upon\\npoetry simply as a department of _belles lettres_, so in most cases did\\ntheir contemporaries.  Since Mrs. Browning’s day our woods have become\\nfull of singing birds, and if I venture to ask them to apply themselves\\nmore to prose and less to song, it is not that I like poetical prose, but\\nthat I love the prose of poets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVENUS OR VICTORY\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, February 24, 1888.)\\n\\n\\nThere are certain problems in archæology that seem to possess a real\\nromantic interest, and foremost among these is the question of the\\nso-called Venus of Melos.  Who is she, this marble mutilated goddess whom\\nGautier loved, to whom Heine bent his knee?  What sculptor wrought her,\\nand for what shrine?  Whose hands walled her up in that rude niche where\\nthe Melian peasant found her?  What symbol of her divinity did she carry?\\nWas it apple of gold or shield of bronze?  Where is her city and what was\\nher name among gods and men?  The last writer on this fascinating subject\\nis Mr. Stillman, who in a most interesting book recently published in\\nAmerica, claims that the work of art in question is no sea-born and\\nfoam-born Aphrodite, but the very Victory Without Wings that once stood\\nin the little chapel outside the gates of the Acropolis at Athens.  So\\nlong ago as 1826, that is to say six years after the discovery of the\\nstatue, the Venus hypothesis was violently attacked by Millingen, and\\nfrom that time to this the battle of the archæologists has never ceased.\\nMr. Stillman, who fights, of course, under Millingen’s banner, points out\\nthat the statue is not of the Venus type at all, being far too heroic in\\ncharacter to correspond to the Greek conception of Aphrodite at any\\nperiod of their artistic development, but that it agrees distinctly with\\ncertain well-known statues of Victory, such as the celebrated ‘Victory of\\nBrescia.’  The latter is in bronze, is later, and has the wings, but the\\ntype is unmistakable, and though not a reproduction it is certainly a\\nrecollection of the Melian statue.  The representation of Victory on the\\ncoin of Agathocles is also obviously of the Melian type, and in the\\nmuseum of Naples is a terra-cotta Victory in almost the identical action\\nand drapery.  As for Dumont d’Urville’s statement that, when the statue\\nwas discovered, one hand held an apple and the other a fold of the\\ndrapery, the latter is obviously a mistake, and the whole evidence on the\\nsubject is so contradictory that no reliance can be placed on the\\nstatement made by the French Consul and the French naval officers, none\\nof whom seems to have taken the trouble to ascertain whether the arm and\\nhand now in the Louvre were really found in the same niche as the statue\\nat all.  At any rate, these fragments seem to be of extremely inferior\\nworkmanship, and they are so imperfect that they are quite worthless as\\ndata for measure or opinion.  So far, Mr. Stillman is on old ground.  His\\nreal artistic discovery is this.  In working about the Acropolis of\\nAthens, some years ago, he photographed among other sculptures the\\nmutilated Victories in the Temple of Nikè Apteros, the ‘Wingless\\nVictory,’ the little Ionic temple in which stood that statue of Victory\\nof which it was said that ‘_the Athenians made her without wings that she\\nmight never leave Athens_.’  Looking over the photographs afterwards,\\nwhen the impression of the comparatively diminutive size had passed, he\\nwas struck with the close resemblance of the type to that of the Melian\\nstatue.  Now, this resemblance is so striking that it cannot be\\nquestioned by any one who has an eye for form.  There are the same large\\nheroic proportions, the same ampleness of physical development, and the\\nsame treatment of drapery, and there is also that perfect spiritual\\nkinship which, to any true antiquarian, is one of the most valuable modes\\nof evidence.  Now it is generally admitted on both sides that the Melian\\nstatue is probably Attic in its origin, and belongs certainly to the\\nperiod between Phidias and Praxiteles, that is to say, to the age of\\nScopas, if it be not actually the work of Scopas himself; and as it is to\\nScopas that these bas-reliefs have been always attributed, the similarity\\nof style can, on Mr. Stillman’s hypothesis, be easily accounted for.\\n\\nAs regards the appearance of the statue in Melos, Mr. Stillman points out\\nthat Melos belonged to Athens as late as she had any Greek allegiance,\\nand that it is probable that the statue was sent there for concealment on\\nthe occasion of some siege or invasion.  When this took place, Mr.\\nStillman does not pretend to decide with any degree of certainty, but it\\nis evident that it must have been subsequent to the establishment of the\\nRoman hegemony, as the brickwork of the niche in which the statue was\\nfound is clearly Roman in character, and before the time of Pausanias and\\nPliny, as neither of these antiquaries mentions the statue.  Accepting,\\nthen, the statue as that of the Victory Without Wings, Mr. Stillman\\nagrees with Millingen in supposing that in her left hand she held a\\nbronze shield, the lower rim of which rested on the left knee where some\\nmarks of the kind are easily recognizable, while with her right hand she\\ntraced, or had just finished tracing, the names of the great heroes of\\nAthens.  Valentin’s objection, that if this were so the left thigh would\\nincline outwards so as to secure a balance, Mr. Stillman meets partly by\\nthe analogy of the Victory of Brescia and partly by the evidence of\\nNature herself; for he has had a model photographed in the same position\\nas the statue and holding a shield in the manner he proposes in his\\nrestoration.  The result is precisely the contrary to that which Valentin\\nassumes.  Of course, Mr. Stillman’s solution of the whole matter must not\\nbe regarded as an absolutely scientific demonstration.  It is simply an\\ninduction in which a kind of artistic instinct, not communicable or\\nequally valuable to all people, has had the greatest part, but to this\\nmode of interpretation archæologists as a class have been far too\\nindifferent; and it is certain that in the present case it has given us a\\ntheory which is most fruitful and suggestive.\\n\\nThe little temple of Nikè Apteros has had, as Mr. Stillman reminds us, a\\ndestiny unique of its kind.  Like the Parthenon, it was standing little\\nmore than two hundred years ago, but during the Turkish occupation it was\\nrazed, and its stones all built into the great bastion which covered the\\nfront of the Acropolis and blocked up the staircase to the Propylæa.  It\\nwas dug out and restored, nearly every stone in its place, by two German\\narchitects during the reign of Otho, and it stands again just as\\nPausanias described it on the spot where old Ægeus watched for the return\\nof Theseus from Crete.  In the distance are Salamis and Ægina, and beyond\\nthe purple hills lies Marathon.  If the Melian statue be indeed the\\nVictory Without Wings, she had no unworthy shrine.\\n\\nThere are some other interesting essays in Mr. Stillman’s book on the\\nwonderful topographical knowledge of Ithaca displayed in the _Odyssey_,\\nand discussions of this kind are always interesting as long as there is\\nno attempt to represent Homer as the ordinary literary man; but the\\narticle on the Melian statue is by far the most important and the most\\ndelightful.  Some people will, no doubt, regret the possibility of the\\ndisappearance of the old name, and as Venus not as Victory will still\\nworship the stately goddess, but there are others who will be glad to see\\nin her the image and ideal of that spiritual enthusiasm to which Athens\\nowed her liberty, and by which alone can liberty be won.\\n\\n_On the Track of Ulysses_; _together with an Excursion in Quest of the\\nSo-called Venus of Melos_.  By W. J. Stillman.  (Houghton, Mifflin and\\nCo., Boston.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nM. CARO ON GEORGE SAND\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, April 14, 1888.)\\n\\n\\nThe biography of a very great man from the pen of a very ladylike\\nwriter—this is the best description we can give of M. Caro’s Life of\\nGeorge Sand.  The late Professor of the Sorbonne could chatter charmingly\\nabout culture, and had all the fascinating insincerity of an accomplished\\nphrase-maker; being an extremely superior person he had a great contempt\\nfor Democracy and its doings, but he was always popular with the\\nDuchesses of the Faubourg, as there was nothing in history or in\\nliterature that he could not explain away for their edification; having\\nnever done anything remarkable he was naturally elected a member of the\\nAcademy, and he always remained loyal to the traditions of that\\nthoroughly respectable and thoroughly pretentious institution.  In fact,\\nhe was just the sort of man who should never have attempted to write a\\nLife of George Sand or to interpret George Sand’s genius.  He was too\\nfeminine to appreciate the grandeur of that large womanly nature, too\\nmuch of a _dilettante_ to realize the masculine force of that strong and\\nardent mind.  He never gets at the secret of George Sand, and never\\nbrings us near to her wonderful personality.  He looks on her simply as a\\nlittérateur, as a writer of pretty stories of country life and of\\ncharming, if somewhat exaggerated, romances.  But George Sand was much\\nmore than this.  Beautiful as are such books as _Consuelo_ and _Mauprat_,\\n_François le Champi_ and _La Mare au Diable_, yet in none of them is she\\nadequately expressed, by none of them is she adequately revealed.  As Mr.\\nMatthew Arnold said, many years ago, ‘We do not know George Sand unless\\nwe feel the spirit which goes through her work as a whole.’  With this\\nspirit, however, M. Caro has no sympathy.  Madame Sand’s doctrines are\\nantediluvian, he tells us, her philosophy is quite dead and her ideas of\\nsocial regeneration are Utopian, incoherent and absurd.  The best thing\\nfor us to do is to forget these silly dreams and to read _Teverino_ and\\n_Le Secrétaire Intime_.  Poor M. Caro!  This spirit, which he treats with\\nsuch airy flippancy, is the very leaven of modern life.  It is remoulding\\nthe world for us and fashioning our age anew.  If it is antediluvian, it\\nis so because the deluge is yet to come; if it is Utopian, then Utopia\\nmust be added to our geographies.  To what curious straits M. Caro is\\ndriven by his violent prejudices may be estimated by the fact that he\\ntries to class George Sand’s novels with the old _Chansons de geste_, the\\nstories of adventure characteristic of primitive literatures; whereas in\\nusing fiction as a vehicle of thought, and romance as a means of\\ninfluencing the social ideals of her age, George Sand was merely carrying\\nout the traditions of Voltaire and Rousseau, of Diderot and of\\nChateaubriand.  The novel, says M. Caro, must be allied either to poetry\\nor to science.  That it has found in philosophy one of its strongest\\nallies seems not to have occurred to him.  In an English critic such a\\nview might possibly be excusable.  Our greatest novelists, such as\\nFielding, Scott and Thackeray, cared little for the philosophy of their\\nage.  But coming, as it does, from a French critic, the statement seems\\nto show a strange want of recognition of one of the most important\\nelements of French fiction.  Nor, even in the narrow limits that he has\\nimposed upon himself, can M. Caro be said to be a very fortunate or\\nfelicitous critic.  To take merely one instance out of many, he says\\nnothing of George Sand’s delightful treatment of art and the artist’s\\nlife.  And yet how exquisitely does she analyse each separate art and\\npresent it to us in its relation to life!  In _Consuelo_ she tells us of\\nmusic; in _Horace_ of authorship; in _Le Château des Désertes_ of acting;\\nin _Les Maîtres Mosaïstes_ of mosaic work; in _Le Château de Pictordu_ of\\nportrait painting; and in _La Daniella_ of the painting of landscape.\\nWhat Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Browning have done for England she did for\\nFrance.  She invented an art literature.  It is unnecessary, however, to\\ndiscuss any of M. Caro’s minor failings, for the whole effect of the\\nbook, so far as it attempts to portray for us the scope and character of\\nGeorge Sand’s genius, is entirely spoiled by the false attitude assumed\\nfrom the beginning, and though the dictum may seem to many harsh and\\nexclusive, we cannot help feeling that an absolute incapacity for\\nappreciating the spirit of a great writer is no qualification for writing\\na treatise on the subject.\\n\\nAs for Madame Sand’s private life, which is so intimately connected with\\nher art (for, like Goethe, she had to live her romances before she could\\nwrite them), M. Caro says hardly anything about it.  He passes it over\\nwith a modesty that almost makes one blush, and for fear of wounding the\\nsusceptibilities of those _grandes dames_ whose passions M. Paul Bourget\\nanalyses with such subtlety, he transforms her mother, who was a typical\\nFrench _grisette_, into ‘a very amiable and _spirituelle_ milliner’!  It\\nmust be admitted that Joseph Surface himself could hardly show greater\\ntact and delicacy, though we ourselves must plead guilty to preferring\\nMadame Sand’s own description of her as an ‘enfant du vieux pavé de\\nParis.’\\n\\n_George Sand_.  By the late Elmé Marie Caro.  Translated by Gustave\\nMasson, B.A., Assistant Master, Harrow School.  ‘Great French Writers’\\nSeries.  (Routledge and Sons.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA FASCINATING BOOK\\n(_Woman’s World_, November 1888.)\\n\\n\\nMr. Alan Cole’s carefully-edited translation of M. Lefébure’s history of\\n_Embroidery and Lace_ is one of the most fascinating books that has\\nappeared on this delightful subject.  M. Lefébure is one of the\\nadministrators of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs at Paris, besides being a\\nlace manufacturer; and his work has not merely an important historical\\nvalue, but as a handbook of technical instruction it will be found of the\\ngreatest service by all needle-women.  Indeed, as the translator himself\\npoints out, M. Lefébure’s book suggests the question whether it is not\\nrather by the needle and the bobbin, than by the brush, the graver or the\\nchisel, that the influence of woman should assert itself in the arts.  In\\nEurope, at any rate, woman is sovereign in the domain of art-needlework,\\nand few men would care to dispute with her the right of using those\\ndelicate implements so intimately associated with the dexterity of her\\nnimble and slender fingers; nor is there any reason why the productions\\nof embroidery should not, as Mr. Alan Cole suggests, be placed on the\\nsame level with those of painting, engraving and sculpture, though there\\nmust always be a great difference between those purely decorative arts\\nthat glorify their own material and the more imaginative arts in which\\nthe material is, as it were, annihilated, and absorbed into the creation\\nof a new form.  In the beautifying of modern houses it certainly must be\\nadmitted—indeed, it should be more generally recognized than it is—that\\nrich embroidery on hangings and curtains, _portières_, couches and the\\nlike, produces a far more decorative and far more artistic effect than\\ncan be gained from our somewhat wearisome English practice of covering\\nthe walls with pictures and engravings; and the almost complete\\ndisappearance of embroidery from dress has robbed modern costume of one\\nof the chief elements of grace and fancy.\\n\\nThat, however, a great improvement has taken place in English embroidery\\nduring the last ten or fifteen years cannot, I think, be denied.  It is\\nshown, not merely in the work of individual artists, such as Mrs.\\nHoliday, Miss May Morris and others, but also in the admirable\\nproductions of the South Kensington School of Embroidery (the\\nbest—indeed, the only real good—school that South Kensington has\\nproduced).  It is pleasant to note on turning over the leaves of M.\\nLefébure’s book, that in this we are merely carrying out certain old\\ntraditions of Early English art.  In the seventh century, St. Ethelreda,\\nfirst abbess of the monastery of Ely, made an offering to St. Cuthbert of\\na sacred ornament she had worked with gold and precious stones, and the\\ncope and maniple of St. Cuthbert, which are preserved at Durham, are\\nconsidered to be specimens of _opus Anglicanum_.  In the year 800, the\\nBishop of Durham allotted the income of a farm of two hundred acres for\\nlife to an embroideress named Eanswitha, in consideration of her keeping\\nin repair the vestments of the clergy in his diocese.  The battle\\nstandard of King Alfred was embroidered by Danish Princesses; and the\\nAnglo-Saxon Gudric gave Alcuid a piece of land, on condition that she\\ninstructed his daughter in needle-work.  Queen Mathilda bequeathed to the\\nAbbey of the Holy Trinity at Caen a tunic embroidered at Winchester by\\nthe wife of one Alderet; and when William presented himself to the\\nEnglish nobles, after the Battle of Hastings, he wore a mantle covered\\nwith Anglo-Saxon embroideries, which is probably, M. Lefébure suggests,\\nthe same as that mentioned in the inventory of the Bayeux Cathedral,\\nwhere, after the entry relating to the _broderie à telle_ (representing\\nthe conquest of England), two mantles are described—one of King William,\\n‘all of gold, powdered with crosses and blossoms of gold, and edged along\\nthe lower border with an orphrey of figures.’  The most splendid example\\nof the _opus Anglicanum_ now in existence is, of course, the Syon cope at\\nthe South Kensington Museum; but English work seems to have been\\ncelebrated all over the Continent.  Pope Innocent IV. so admired the\\nsplendid vestments worn by the English clergy in 1246, that he ordered\\nsimilar articles from Cistercian monasteries in England.  St. Dunstan,\\nthe artistic English monk, was known as a designer for embroideries; and\\nthe stole of St. Thomas à Becket is still preserved in the cathedral at\\nSens, and shows us the interlaced scroll-forms used by Anglo-Saxon MS.\\nilluminators.\\n\\nHow far this modern artistic revival of rich and delicate embroidery will\\nbear fruit depends, of course, almost entirely on the energy and study\\nthat women are ready to devote to it; but I think that it must be\\nadmitted that all our decorative arts in Europe at present have, at\\nleast, this element of strength—that they are in immediate relationship\\nwith the decorative arts of Asia.  Wherever we find in European history a\\nrevival of decorative art, it has, I fancy, nearly always been due to\\nOriental influence and contact with Oriental nations.  Our own keenly\\nintellectual art has more than once been ready to sacrifice real\\ndecorative beauty either to imitative presentation or to ideal motive.\\nIt has taken upon itself the burden of expression, and has sought to\\ninterpret the secrets of thought and passion.  In its marvellous truth of\\npresentation it has found its strength, and yet its weakness is there\\nalso.  It is never with impunity that an art seeks to mirror life.  If\\nTruth has her revenge upon those who do not follow her, she is often\\npitiless to her worshippers.  In Byzantium the two arts met—Greek art,\\nwith its intellectual sense of form, and its quick sympathy with\\nhumanity; Oriental art, with its gorgeous materialism, its frank\\nrejection of imitation, its wonderful secrets of craft and colour, its\\nsplendid textures, its rare metals and jewels, its marvellous and\\npriceless traditions.  They had, indeed, met before, but in Byzantium\\nthey were married; and the sacred tree of the Persians, the palm of\\nZoroaster, was embroidered on the hem of the garments of the Western\\nworld.  Even the Iconoclasts, the Philistines of theological history,\\nwho, in one of those strange outbursts of rage against Beauty that seem\\nto occur only amongst European nations, rose up against the wonder and\\nmagnificence of the new art, served merely to distribute its secrets more\\nwidely; and in the _Liber Pontificalis_, written in 687 by Athanasius,\\nthe librarian, we read of an influx into Rome of gorgeous embroideries,\\nthe work of men who had arrived from Constantinople and from Greece.  The\\ntriumph of the Mussulman gave the decorative art of Europe a new\\ndeparture—that very principle of their religion that forbade the actual\\nrepresentation of any object in nature being of the greatest artistic\\nservice to them, though it was not, of course, strictly carried out.  The\\nSaracens introduced into Sicily the art of weaving silken and golden\\nfabrics; and from Sicily the manufacture of fine stuffs spread to the\\nNorth of Italy, and became localized in Genoa, Florence, Venice, and\\nother towns.  A still greater art-movement took place in Spain under the\\nMoors and Saracens, who brought over workmen from Persia to make\\nbeautiful things for them.  M. Lefébure tells us of Persian embroidery\\npenetrating as far as Andalusia; and Almeria, like Palermo, had its Hôtel\\ndes Tiraz, which rivalled the Hôtel des Tiraz at Bagdad, _tiraz_ being\\nthe generic name for ornamental tissues and costumes made with them.\\nSpangles (those pretty little discs of gold, silver, or polished steel,\\nused in certain embroidery for dainty glinting effects) were a Saracenic\\ninvention; and Arabic letters often took the place of letters in the\\nRoman characters for use in inscriptions upon embroidered robes and\\nMiddle Age tapestries, their decorative value being so much greater.  The\\nbook of crafts by Etienne Boileau, provost of the merchants in 1258–1268,\\ncontains a curious enumeration of the different craft-guilds of Paris,\\namong which we find ‘the tapiciers, or makers of the _tapis sarrasinois_\\n(or Saracen cloths), who say that their craft is for the service only of\\nchurches, or great men like kings and counts’; and, indeed, even in our\\nown day, nearly all our words descriptive of decorative textures and\\ndecorative methods point to an Oriental origin.  What the inroads of the\\nMohammedans did for Sicily and Spain, the return of the Crusaders did for\\nthe other countries of Europe.  The nobles who left for Palestine clad in\\narmour, came back in the rich stuffs of the East; and their costumes,\\npouches (_aumônières sarrasinoises_), and caparisons excited the\\nadmiration of the needle-workers of the West.  Matthew Paris says that at\\nthe sacking of Antioch, in 1098, gold, silver and priceless costumes were\\nso equally distributed among the Crusaders, that many who the night\\nbefore were famishing and imploring relief, suddenly found themselves\\noverwhelmed with wealth; and Robert de Clair tells us of the wonderful\\nfêtes that followed the capture of Constantinople.  The thirteenth\\ncentury, as M. Lefébure points out, was conspicuous for an increased\\ndemand in the West for embroidery.  Many Crusaders made offerings to\\nchurches of plunder from Palestine; and St. Louis, on his return from the\\nfirst Crusade, offered thanks at St. Denis to God for mercies bestowed on\\nhim during his six years’ absence and travel, and presented some richly\\nembroidered stuffs to be used on great occasions as coverings to the\\nreliquaries containing the relics of holy martyrs.  European embroidery,\\nhaving thus become possessed of new materials and wonderful methods,\\ndeveloped on its own intellectual and imitative lines, inclining, as it\\nwent on, to the purely pictorial, and seeking to rival painting, and to\\nproduce landscapes and figure-subjects with elaborate perspective and\\nsubtle aerial effects.  A fresh Oriental influence, however, came through\\nthe Dutch and the Portuguese, and the famous _Compagnie des Grandes\\nIndes_; and M. Lefébure gives an illustration of a door-hanging now in\\nthe Cluny Museum, where we find the French _fleurs-de-lys_ intermixed\\nwith Indian ornament.  The hangings of Madame de Maintenon’s room at\\nFontainebleau, which were embroidered at St. Cyr, represent Chinese\\nscenery upon a jonquil-yellow ground.\\n\\nClothes were sent out ready cut to the East to be embroidered, and many\\nof the delightful coats of the period of Louis XV. and Louis XVI. owe\\ntheir dainty decoration to the needles of Chinese artists.  In our own\\nday the influence of the East is strongly marked.  Persia has sent us her\\ncarpets for patterns, and Cashmere her lovely shawls, and India her\\ndainty muslins finely worked with gold thread palmates, and stitched over\\nwith iridescent beetles’ wings.  We are beginning now to dye by Oriental\\nmethods, and the silk robes of China and Japan have taught us new wonders\\nof colour-combination, and new subtleties of delicate design.  Whether we\\nhave yet learned to make a wise use of what we have acquired is less\\ncertain.  If books produce an effect, this book of M. Lefébure should\\ncertainly make us study with still deeper interest the whole question of\\nembroidery, and by those who already work with their needles it will be\\nfound full of most fertile suggestion and most admirable advice.\\n\\nEven to read of the marvellous works of embroidery that were fashioned in\\nbygone ages is pleasant.  Time has kept a few fragments of Greek\\nembroidery of the fourth century B.C. for us.  One is figured in M.\\nLefébure’s book—a chain-stitch embroidery of yellow flax upon a\\nmulberry-coloured worsted material, with graceful spirals and\\npalmetto-patterns: and another, a tapestried cloth powdered with ducks,\\nwas reproduced in the _Woman’s World_ some months ago for an article by\\nMr. Alan Cole. {115}  Now and then we find in the tomb of some dead\\nEgyptian a piece of delicate work.  In the treasury at Ratisbon is\\npreserved a specimen of Byzantine embroidery on which the Emperor\\nConstantine is depicted riding on a white palfrey, and receiving homage\\nfrom the East and West.  Metz has a red silk cope wrought with great\\neagles, the gift of Charlemagne, and Bayeux the needle-wrought epic of\\nQueen Matilda.  But where is the great crocus-coloured robe, wrought for\\nAthena, on which the gods fought against the giants?  Where is the huge\\nvelarium that Nero stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, on which was\\nrepresented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by steeds?\\nHow one would like to see the curious table-napkins wrought for\\nHeliogabalus, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that\\ncould be wanted for a feast; or the mortuary-cloth of King Chilperic,\\nwith its three hundred golden bees; or the fantastic robes that excited\\nthe indignation of the Bishop of Pontus, and were embroidered with\\n‘lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters—all, in fact, that\\npainters can copy from nature.’  Charles of Orleans had a coat, on the\\nsleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning\\n‘_Madame_, _je suis tout joyeux_,’ the musical accompaniment of the words\\nbeing wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those\\ndays, formed with four pearls. {116}  The room prepared in the palace at\\nRheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy was decorated with ‘thirteen\\nhundred and twenty-one _papegauts_ (parrots) made in broidery and\\nblazoned with the King’s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one\\nbutterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the Queen’s\\narms—the whole worked in fine gold.’  Catherine de Medicis had a\\nmourning-bed made for her ‘of black velvet embroidered with pearls and\\npowdered with crescents and suns.’  Its curtains were of damask, ‘with\\nleafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silver ground, and\\nfringed along the edges with broideries of pearls,’ and it stood in a\\nroom hung with rows of the Queen’s devices in cut black velvet on cloth\\nof silver.  Louis XIV. had gold-embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high\\nin his apartment.  The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of\\nSmyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises and pearls, with verses\\nfrom the Koran; its supports were of silver-gilt, beautifully chased and\\nprofusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions.  He had taken it\\nfrom the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mahomet had\\nstood under it.  The Duchess de la Ferté wore a dress of reddish-brown\\nvelvet, the skirt of which, adjusted in graceful folds, was held up by\\nbig butterflies made of Dresden china; the front was a _tablier_ of cloth\\nof silver, upon which was embroidered an orchestra of musicians arranged\\nin a pyramidal group, consisting of a series of six ranks of performers,\\nwith beautiful instruments wrought in raised needle-work.  ‘Into the\\nnight go one and all,’ as Mr. Henley sings in his charming _Ballade of\\nDead Actors_.\\n\\nMany of the facts related by M. Lefébure about the embroiderers’ guilds\\nare also extremely interesting.  Etienne Boileau, in his book of crafts,\\nto which I have already alluded, tells us that a member of the guild was\\nprohibited from using gold of less value than ‘eight sous (about 6s.) the\\nskein; he was bound to use the best silk, and never to mix thread with\\nsilk, because that made the work false and bad.’  The test or trial piece\\nprescribed for a worker who was the son of a master-embroiderer was ‘a\\nsingle figure, a sixth of the natural size, to be shaded in gold’; whilst\\none not the son of a master was required to produce ‘a complete incident\\nwith many figures.’  The book of crafts also mentions ‘cutters-out and\\nstencillers and illuminators’ amongst those employed in the industry of\\nembroidery.  In 1551 the Parisian Corporation of Embroiderers issued a\\nnotice that ‘for the future, the colouring in representations of nude\\nfigures and faces should be done in three or four gradations of\\ncarnation-dyed silk, and not, as formerly, in white silks.’  During the\\nfifteenth century every household of any position retained the services\\nof an embroiderer by the year.  The preparation of colours also, whether\\nfor painting or for dyeing threads and textile fabrics, was a matter\\nwhich, M. Lefébure points out, received close attention from the artists\\nof the Middle Ages.  Many undertook long journeys to obtain the more\\nfamous recipes, which they filed, subsequently adding to and correcting\\nthem as experience dictated.  Nor were great artists above making and\\nsupplying designs for embroidery.  Raphael made designs for Francis I.,\\nand Boucher for Louis XV.; and in the Ambras collection at Vienna is a\\nsuperb set of sacerdotal robes from designs by the brothers Van Eyck and\\ntheir pupils.  Early in the sixteenth century books of embroidery designs\\nwere produced, and their success was so great that in a few years French,\\nGerman, Italian, Flemish, and English publishers spread broadcast books\\nof design made by their best engravers.  In the same century, in order to\\ngive the designers opportunity of studying directly from nature, Jean\\nRobin opened a garden with conservatories, in which he cultivated strange\\nvarieties of plants then but little known in our latitudes.  The rich\\nbrocades and brocadelles of the time are characterized by the\\nintroduction of large flowery patterns, with pomegranates and other\\nfruits with fine foliage.\\n\\nThe second part of M. Lefébure’s book is devoted to the history of lace,\\nand though some may not find it quite as interesting as the earlier\\nportion it will more than repay perusal; and those who still work in this\\ndelicate and fanciful art will find many valuable suggestions in it, as\\nwell as a large number of exceedingly beautiful designs.  Compared to\\nembroidery, lace seems comparatively modern.  M. Lefébure and Mr. Alan\\nCole tell us that there is no reliable or documentary evidence to prove\\nthe existence of lace before the fifteenth century.  Of course in the\\nEast, light tissues, such as gauzes, muslins, and nets, were made at very\\nearly times, and were used as veils and scarfs after the manner of\\nsubsequent laces, and women enriched them with some sort of embroidery,\\nor varied the openness of them by here and there drawing out threads.\\nThe threads of fringes seem also to have been plaited and knotted\\ntogether, and the borders of one of the many fashions of Roman toga were\\nof open reticulated weaving.  The Egyptian Museum at the Louvre has a\\ncurious network embellished with glass beads; and the monk Reginald, who\\ntook part in opening the tomb of St. Cuthbert at Durham in the twelfth\\ncentury, writes that the Saint’s shroud had a fringe of linen threads an\\ninch long, surmounted by a border, ‘worked upon the threads,’ with\\nrepresentations of birds and pairs of beasts, there being between each\\nsuch pair a branching tree, a survival of the palm of Zoroaster, to which\\nI have before alluded.  Our authors, however, do not in these examples\\nrecognize lace, the production of which involves more refined and\\nartistic methods, and postulates a combination of skill and varied\\nexecution carried to a higher degree of perfection.  Lace, as we know it,\\nseems to have had its origin in the habit of embroidering linen.  White\\nembroidery on linen has, M. Lefébure remarks, a cold and monotonous\\naspect; that with coloured threads is brighter and gayer in effect, but\\nis apt to fade in frequent washing; but white embroidery relieved by open\\nspaces in, or shapes cut from, the linen ground, is possessed of an\\nentirely new charm; and from a sense of this the birth may be traced of\\nan art in the result of which happy contrasts are effected between\\nornamental details of close texture and others of open-work.\\n\\nSoon, also, was suggested the idea that, instead of laboriously\\nwithdrawing threads from stout linen, it would be more convenient to\\nintroduce a needle-made pattern into an open network ground, which was\\ncalled a _lacis_.  Of this kind of embroidery many specimens are extant.\\nThe Cluny Museum possesses a linen cap said to have belonged to Charles\\nV.; and an alb of linen drawn-thread work, supposed to have been made by\\nAnne of Bohemia (1527), is preserved in the cathedral at Prague.\\nCatherine de Medicis had a bed draped with squares of _réseuil_, or\\n_lacis_, and it is recorded that ‘the girls and servants of her household\\nconsumed much time in making squares of _réseuil_.’  The interesting\\npattern-books for open-ground embroidery, of which the first was\\npublished in 1527 by Pierre Quinty, of Cologne, supply us with the means\\nof tracing the stages in the transition from white thread embroidery to\\nneedle-point lace.  We meet in them with a style of needle-work which\\ndiffers from embroidery in not being wrought upon a stuff foundation.  It\\nis, in fact, true lace, done, as it were, ‘in the air,’ both ground and\\npattern being entirely produced by the lace-maker.\\n\\nThe elaborate use of lace in costume was, of course, largely stimulated\\nby the fashion of wearing ruffs, and their companion cuffs or sleeves.\\nCatherine de Medicis induced one Frederic Vinciolo to come from Italy and\\nmake ruffs and gadrooned collars, the fashion of which she started in\\nFrance; and Henry III. was so punctilious over his ruffs that he would\\niron and goffer his cuffs and collars himself rather than see their\\npleats limp and out of shape.  The pattern-books also gave a great\\nimpulse to the art.  M. Lefébure mentions German books with patterns of\\neagles, heraldic emblems, hunting scenes, and plants and leaves belonging\\nto Northern vegetation; and Italian books, in which the _motifs_ consist\\nof oleander blossoms, and elegant wreaths and scrolls, landscapes with\\nmythological scenes, and hunting episodes, less realistic than the\\nNorthern ones, in which appear fauns, and nymphs or _amorini_ shooting\\narrows.  With regard to these patterns, M. Lefébure notices a curious\\nfact.  The oldest painting in which lace is depicted is that of a lady,\\nby Carpaccio, who died about 1523.  The cuffs of the lady are edged with\\na narrow lace, the pattern of which reappears in Vecellio’s _Corona_, a\\nbook not published until 1591.  This particular pattern was, therefore,\\nin use at least eighty years before it got into circulation with other\\npublished patterns.\\n\\nIt was not, however, till the seventeenth century that lace acquired a\\nreally independent character and individuality, and M. Duplessis states\\nthat the production of the more noteworthy of early laces owes more to\\nthe influence of men than to that of women.  The reign of Louis XIV.\\nwitnessed the production of the most stately needle-point laces, the\\ntransformation of Venetian point, and the growth of _Points d’Alençon_,\\n_d’Argentan_, _de Bruxelles_ and _d’Angleterre_.\\n\\nThe king, aided by Colbert, determined to make France the centre, if\\npossible, for lace manufacture, sending for this purpose both to Venice\\nand to Flanders for workers.  The studio of the Gobelins supplied\\ndesigns.  The dandies had their huge rabatos or bands falling from\\nbeneath the chin over the breast, and great prelates, like Bossuet and\\nFénelon, wore their wonderful albs and rochets.  It is related of a\\ncollar made at Venice for Louis XIV. that the lace-workers, being unable\\nto find sufficiently fine horse-hair, employed some of their own hairs\\ninstead, in order to secure that marvellous delicacy of work which they\\naimed at producing.\\n\\nIn the eighteenth century, Venice, finding that laces of lighter texture\\nwere sought after, set herself to make rose-point; and at the Court of\\nLouis XV. the choice of lace was regulated by still more elaborate\\netiquette.  The Revolution, however, ruined many of the manufactures.\\nAlençon survived, and Napoleon encouraged it, and endeavoured to renew\\nthe old rules about the necessity of wearing point-lace at Court\\nreceptions.  A wonderful piece of lace, powdered over with devices of\\nbees, and costing 40,000 francs, was ordered.  It was begun for the\\nEmpress Josephine, but in the course of its making her escutcheons were\\nreplaced by those of Marie Louise.\\n\\nM. Lefébure concludes his interesting history by stating very clearly his\\nattitude towards machine-made lace.  ‘It would be an obvious loss to\\nart,’ he says, ‘should the making of lace by hand become extinct, for\\nmachinery, as skilfully devised as possible, cannot do what the hand\\ndoes.’  It can give us ‘the results of processes, not the creations of\\nartistic handicraft.’  Art is absent ‘where formal calculation pretends\\nto supersede emotion’; it is absent ‘where no trace can be detected of\\nintelligence guiding handicraft, whose hesitancies even possess peculiar\\ncharm . . . cheapness is never commendable in respect of things which are\\nnot absolute necessities; it lowers artistic standard.’  These are\\nadmirable remarks, and with them we take leave of this fascinating book,\\nwith its delightful illustrations, its charming anecdotes, its excellent\\nadvice.  Mr. Alan Cole deserves the thanks of all who are interested in\\nart for bringing this book before the public in so attractive and so\\ninexpensive a form.\\n\\n_Embroidery and Lace_: _Their Manufacture and History from the Remotest\\nAntiquity to the Present Day_.  Translated and enlarged by Alan S. Cole\\nfrom the French of Ernest Lefébure.  (Grevel and Co.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHENLEY’S POEMS\\n(_Woman’s World_, December 1888.)\\n\\n\\n‘If I were king,’ says Mr. Henley, in one of his most modest rondeaus,\\n\\n    ‘Art should aspire, yet ugliness be dear;\\n    Beauty, the shaft, should speed with wit for feather;\\n    And love, sweet love, should never fall to sere,\\n             If I were king.’\\n\\nAnd these lines contain, if not the best criticism of his own work,\\ncertainly a very complete statement of his aim and motive as a poet.  His\\nlittle _Book of Verses_ reveals to us an artist who is seeking to find\\nnew methods of expression and has not merely a delicate sense of beauty\\nand a brilliant, fantastic wit, but a real passion also for what is\\nhorrible, ugly, or grotesque.  No doubt, everything that is worthy of\\nexistence is worthy also of art—at least, one would like to think so—but\\nwhile echo or mirror can repeat for us a beautiful thing, to render\\nartistically a thing that is ugly requires the most exquisite alchemy of\\nform, the most subtle magic of transformation.  To me there is more of\\nthe cry of Marsyas than of the singing of Apollo in the earlier poems of\\nMr. Henley’s volume, _In Hospital_: _Rhymes and Rhythms_, as he calls\\nthem.  But it is impossible to deny their power.  Some of them are like\\nbright, vivid pastels; others like charcoal drawings, with dull blacks\\nand murky whites; others like etchings with deeply-bitten lines, and\\nabrupt contrasts, and clever colour-suggestions.  In fact, they are like\\nanything and everything, except perfected poems—that they certainly are\\nnot.  They are still in the twilight.  They are preludes, experiments,\\ninspired jottings in a note-book, and should be heralded by a design of\\n‘Genius Making Sketches.’  Rhyme gives architecture as well as melody to\\nverse; it gives that delightful sense of limitation which in all the arts\\nis so pleasurable, and is, indeed, one of the secrets of perfection; it\\nwill whisper, as a French critic has said, ‘things unexpected and\\ncharming, things with strange and remote relations to each other,’ and\\nbind them together in indissoluble bonds of beauty; and in his constant\\nrejection of rhyme, Mr. Henley seems to me to have abdicated half his\\npower.  He is a _roi en exil_ who has thrown away some of the strings of\\nhis lute; a poet who has forgotten the fairest part of his kingdom.\\n\\nHowever, all work criticizes itself.  Here is one of Mr. Henley’s\\ninspired jottings.  According to the temperament of the reader, it will\\nserve either as a model or as the reverse:\\n\\n    As with varnish red and glistening\\n       Dripped his hair; his feet were rigid;\\n       Raised, he settled stiffly sideways:\\n       You could see the hurts were spinal.\\n\\n    He had fallen from an engine,\\n       And been dragged along the metals.\\n       It was hopeless, and they knew it;\\n       So they covered him, and left him.\\n\\n    As he lay, by fits half sentient,\\n       Inarticulately moaning,\\n       With his stockinged feet protruded\\n       Sharp and awkward from the blankets,\\n\\n    To his bed there came a woman,\\n       Stood and looked and sighed a little,\\n       And departed without speaking,\\n       As himself a few hours after.\\n\\n    I was told she was his sweetheart.\\n       They were on the eve of marriage.\\n       She was quiet as a statue,\\n       But her lip was gray and writhen.\\n\\nIn this poem, the rhythm and the music, such as it is, are\\nobvious—perhaps a little too obvious.  In the following I see nothing but\\ningeniously printed prose.  It is a description—and a very accurate\\none—of a scene in a hospital ward.  The medical students are supposed to\\nbe crowding round the doctor.  What I quote is only a fragment, but the\\npoem itself is a fragment:\\n\\n    So shows the ring\\n    Seen, from behind, round a conjuror\\n    Doing his pitch in the street.\\n    High shoulders, low shoulders, broad shoulders, narrow ones,\\n    Round, square, and angular, serry and shove;\\n    While from within a voice,\\n    Gravely and weightily fluent,\\n    Sounds; and then ceases; and suddenly\\n    (Look at the stress of the shoulders!)\\n    Out of a quiver of silence,\\n    Over the hiss of the spray,\\n    Comes a low cry, and the sound\\n    Of breath quick intaken through teeth\\n    Clenched in resolve.  And the master\\n    Breaks from the crowd, and goes,\\n    Wiping his hands,\\n    To the next bed, with his pupils\\n    Flocking and whispering behind him.\\n\\n    Now one can see.\\n    Case Number One\\n    Sits (rather pale) with his bedclothes\\n    Stripped up, and showing his foot\\n    (Alas, for God’s image!)\\n    Swaddled in wet white lint\\n    Brilliantly hideous with red.\\n\\nThéophile Gautier once said that Flaubert’s style was meant to be read,\\nand his own style to be looked at.  Mr. Henley’s unrhymed rhythms form\\nvery dainty designs, from a typographical point of view.  From the point\\nof view of literature, they are a series of vivid, concentrated\\nimpressions, with a keen grip of fact, a terrible actuality, and an\\nalmost masterly power of picturesque presentation.  But the poetic\\nform—what of that?\\n\\nWell, let us pass to the later poems, to the rondels and rondeaus, the\\nsonnets and quatorzains, the echoes and the ballades.  How brilliant and\\nfanciful this is!  The Toyokuni colour-print that suggested it could not\\nbe more delightful.  It seems to have kept all the wilful fantastic charm\\nof the original:\\n\\n    Was I a Samurai renowned,\\n    Two-sworded, fierce, immense of bow?\\n    A histrion angular and profound?\\n    A priest? a porter?—Child, although\\n    I have forgotten clean, I know\\n    That in the shade of Fujisan,\\n    What time the cherry-orchards blow,\\n    I loved you once in old Japan.\\n\\n    As here you loiter, flowing-gowned\\n    And hugely sashed, with pins a-row\\n    Your quaint head as with flamelets crowned,\\n    Demure, inviting—even so,\\n    When merry maids in Miyako\\n    To feel the sweet o’ the year began,\\n    And green gardens to overflow,\\n    I loved you once in old Japan.\\n\\n    Clear shine the hills; the rice-fields round\\n    Two cranes are circling; sleepy and slow,\\n    A blue canal the lake’s blue bound\\n    Breaks at the bamboo bridge; and lo!\\n    Touched with the sundown’s spirit and glow,\\n    I see you turn, with flirted fan,\\n    Against the plum-tree’s bloomy snow . . .\\n    I loved you once in old Japan!\\n\\n                                    ENVOY.\\n\\n    Dear, ’twas a dozen lives ago\\n    But that I was a lucky man\\n    The Toyokuni here will show:\\n    I loved you—once—in old Japan!\\n\\nThis rondel, too—how light it is, and graceful!—\\n\\n    We’ll to the woods and gather may\\n    Fresh from the footprints of the rain.\\n    We’ll to the woods, at every vein\\n    To drink the spirit of the day.\\n\\n    The winds of spring are out at play,\\n    The needs of spring in heart and brain.\\n    We’ll to the woods and gather may\\n    Fresh from the footprints of the rain.\\n\\n    The world’s too near her end, you say?\\n    Hark to the blackbird’s mad refrain!\\n    It waits for her, the vast Inane?\\n    Then, girls, to help her on the way\\n    We’ll to the woods and gather may.\\n\\nThere are fine verses, also, scattered through this little book; some of\\nthem very strong, as—\\n\\n    Out of the night that covers me,\\n       Black as the pit from pole to pole,\\n    I thank whatever gods may be\\n       For my unconquerable soul.\\n\\n    It matters not how strait the gate,\\n       How charged with punishments the scroll,\\n    I am the master of my fate:\\n       I am the captain of my soul.\\n\\nOthers with a true touch of romance, as—\\n\\n    Or ever the knightly years were gone\\n       With the old world to the grave,\\n    I was a king in Babylon,\\n       And you were a Christian slave.\\n\\nAnd here and there we come across such felicitous phrases as—\\n\\n             In the sand\\n    The gold prow-griffin claws a hold,\\n\\nor—\\n\\n             The spires\\n    Shine and are changed,\\n\\nand many other graceful or fanciful lines, even ‘the green sky’s minor\\nthirds’ being perfectly right in its place, and a very refreshing bit of\\naffectation in a volume where there is so much that is natural.\\n\\nHowever, Mr. Henley is not to be judged by samples.  Indeed, the most\\nattractive thing in the book is no single poem that is in it, but the\\nstrong humane personality that stands behind both flawless and faulty\\nwork alike, and looks out through many masks, some of them beautiful, and\\nsome grotesque, and not a few misshapen.  In the case with most of our\\nmodern poets, when we have analysed them down to an adjective, we can go\\nno further, or we care to go no further; but with this book it is\\ndifferent.  Through these reeds and pipes blows the very breath of life.\\nIt seems as if one could put one’s hand upon the singer’s heart and count\\nits pulsations.  There is something wholesome, virile and sane about the\\nman’s soul.  Anybody can be reasonable, but to be sane is not common; and\\nsane poets are as rare as blue lilies, though they may not be quite so\\ndelightful.\\n\\n    Let the great winds their worst and wildest blow,\\n    Or the gold weather round us mellow slow;\\n    We have fulfilled ourselves, and we can dare,\\n    And we can conquer, though we may not share\\n    In the rich quiet of the afterglow,\\n             What is to come,\\n\\nis the concluding stanza of the last rondeau—indeed, of the last poem in\\nthe collection, and the high, serene temper displayed in these lines\\nserves at once as keynote and keystone to the book.  The very lightness\\nand slightness of so much of the work, its careless moods and casual\\nfancies, seem to suggest a nature that is not primarily interested in\\nart—a nature, like Sordello’s, passionately enamoured of life, one to\\nwhich lyre and lute are things of less importance.  From this mere joy of\\nliving, this frank delight in experience for its own sake, this lofty\\nindifference, and momentary unregretted ardours, come all the faults and\\nall the beauties of the volume.  But there is this difference between\\nthem—the faults are deliberate, and the result of much study; the\\nbeauties have the air of fascinating impromptus.  Mr. Henley’s healthy,\\nif sometimes misapplied, confidence in the myriad suggestions of life\\ngives him his charm.  He is made to sing along the highways, not to sit\\ndown and write.  If he took himself more seriously, his work would become\\ntrivial.\\n\\n_A Book of Verses_.  By William Ernest Henley.  (David Nutt.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSOME LITERARY LADIES\\n(_Woman’s World_, January 1889.)\\n\\n\\nIn a recent article on _English Poetesses_, I ventured to suggest that\\nour women of letters should turn their attention somewhat more to prose\\nand somewhat less to poetry.  Women seem to me to possess just what our\\nliterature wants—a light touch, a delicate hand, a graceful mode of\\ntreatment, and an unstudied felicity of phrase.  We want some one who\\nwill do for our prose what Madame de Sévigné did for the prose of France.\\nGeorge Eliot’s style was far too cumbrous, and Charlotte Brontë’s too\\nexaggerated.  However, one must not forget that amongst the women of\\nEngland there have been some charming letter-writers, and certainly no\\nbook can be more delightful reading than Mrs. Ross’s _Three Generations\\nof English Women_, which has recently appeared.  The three Englishwomen\\nwhose memoirs and correspondence Mrs. Ross has so admirably edited are\\nMrs. John Taylor, Mrs. Sarah Austin, and Lady Duff Gordon, all of them\\nremarkable personalities, and two of them women of brilliant wit and\\nEuropean reputation.  Mrs. Taylor belonged to that great Norwich family\\nabout whom the Duke of Sussex remarked that they reversed the ordinary\\nsaying that it takes nine tailors to make a man, and was for many years\\none of the most distinguished figures in the famous society of her native\\ntown.  Her only daughter married John Austin, the great authority on\\njurisprudence, and her _salon_ in Paris was the centre of the intellect\\nand culture of her day.  Lucie Duff Gordon, the only child of John and\\nSarah Austin, inherited the talents of her parents.  A beauty, a _femme\\nd’esprit_, a traveller, and clever writer, she charmed and fascinated her\\nage, and her premature death in Egypt was really a loss to our\\nliterature.  It is to her daughter that we owe this delightful volume of\\nmemoirs.\\n\\nFirst we are introduced to Mrs. Ross’s great-grandmother, Mrs. Taylor,\\nwho ‘was called, by her intimate friends, “Madame Roland of Norwich,”\\nfrom her likeness to the portraits of the handsome and unfortunate\\nFrenchwoman.’  We hear of her darning her boy’s grey worsted stockings\\nwhile holding her own with Southey and Brougham, and dancing round the\\nTree of Liberty with Dr. Parr when the news of the fall of the Bastille\\nwas first known.  Amongst her friends were Sir James Mackintosh, the most\\npopular man of the day, ‘to whom Madame de Staël wrote, “Il n’y a pas de\\nsociété sans vous.”  “C’est très ennuyeux de dîner sans vous; la société\\nne va pas quand vous n’êtes pas là”;’ Sir James Smith, the botanist;\\nCrabb Robinson; the Gurneys; Mrs. Barbauld; Dr. Alderson and his charming\\ndaughter, Amelia Opie; and many other well-known people.  Her letters are\\nextremely sensible and thoughtful.  ‘Nothing at present,’ she says in one\\nof them, ‘suits my taste so well as Susan’s Latin lessons, and her\\nphilosophical old master. . . . When we get to Cicero’s discussions on\\nthe nature of the soul, or Virgil’s fine descriptions, my mind is filled\\nup.  Life is either a dull round of eating, drinking, and sleeping, or a\\nspark of ethereal fire just kindled. . . . The character of girls must\\ndepend upon their reading as much as upon the company they keep.  Besides\\nthe intrinsic pleasure to be derived from solid knowledge, a woman ought\\nto consider it as her best resource against poverty.’  This is a somewhat\\ncaustic aphorism: ‘A romantic woman is a troublesome friend, as she\\nexpects you to be as impudent as herself, and is mortified at what she\\ncalls coldness and insensibility.’  And this is admirable: ‘The art of\\nlife is not to estrange oneself from society, and yet not to pay too dear\\nfor it.’  This, too, is good: ‘Vanity, like curiosity, is wanted as a\\nstimulus to exertion; indolence would certainly get the better of us if\\nit were not for these two powerful principles’; and there is a keen touch\\nof humour in the following: ‘Nothing is so gratifying as the idea that\\nvirtue and philanthropy are becoming fashionable.’  Dr. James Martineau,\\nin a letter to Mrs. Ross, gives us a pleasant picture of the old lady\\nreturning from market ‘weighted by her huge basket, with the shank of a\\nleg of mutton thrust out to betray its contents,’ and talking divinely\\nabout philosophy, poets, politics, and every intellectual topic of the\\nday.  She was a woman of admirable good sense, a type of Roman matron,\\nand quite as careful as were the Roman matrons to keep up the purity of\\nher native tongue.\\n\\nMrs. Taylor, however, was more or less limited to Norwich.  Mrs. Austin\\nwas for the world.  In London, Paris, and Germany, she ruled and\\ndominated society, loved by every one who knew her.  ‘She is “My best and\\nbrightest” to Lord Jeffrey; “Dear, fair and wise” to Sydney Smith; “My\\ngreat ally” to Sir James Stephen; “Sunlight through waste weltering\\nchaos” to Thomas Carlyle (while he needed her aid); “La petite mère du\\ngenre humain” to Michael Chevalier; “Liebes Mütterlein” to John Stuart\\nMill; and “My own Professorin” to Charles Buller, to whom she taught\\nGerman, as well as to the sons of Mr. James Mill.’  Jeremy Bentham, when\\non his deathbed, gave her a ring with his portrait and some of his hair\\nlet in behind.  ‘There, my dear,’ he said, ‘it is the only ring I ever\\ngave a woman.’  She corresponded with Guizot, Barthelemy de St. Hilaire,\\nthe Grotes, Dr. Whewell, the Master of Trinity, Nassau Senior, the\\nDuchesse d’Orléans, Victor Cousin, and many other distinguished people.\\nHer translation of Ranke’s _History of the Popes_ is admirable; indeed,\\nall her literary work was thoroughly well done, and her edition of her\\nhusband’s _Province of Jurisprudence_ deserves the very highest praise.\\nTwo people more unlike than herself and her husband it would have been\\ndifficult to find.  He was habitually grave and despondent; she was\\nbrilliantly handsome, fond of society, in which she shone, and ‘with an\\nalmost superabundance of energy and animal spirits,’ Mrs. Ross tells us.\\nShe married him because she thought him perfect, but he never produced\\nthe work of which he was worthy, and of which she knew him to be worthy.\\nHer estimate of him in the preface to the _Jurisprudence_ is wonderfully\\nstriking and simple.  ‘He was never sanguine.  He was intolerant of any\\nimperfection.  He was always under the control of severe love of truth.\\nHe lived and died a poor man.’  She was terribly disappointed in him, but\\nshe loved him.  Some years after his death, she wrote to M. Guizot:\\n\\n    In the intervals of my study of his works I read his letters to\\n    me—_forty-five years of love-letters_, the last as tender and\\n    passionate as the first.  And how full of noble sentiments!  The\\n    midday of our lives was clouded and stormy, full of cares and\\n    disappointments; but the sunset was bright and serene—as bright as\\n    the morning, and _more_ serene.  Now it is night with me, and must\\n    remain so till the dawn of another day.  I am always alone—that is,\\n    _I live with him_.\\n\\nThe most interesting letters in the book are certainly those to M.\\nGuizot, with whom she maintained the closest intellectual friendship; but\\nthere is hardly one of them that does not contain something clever, or\\nthoughtful, or witty, while those addressed to her, in turn, are very\\ninteresting.  Carlyle writes her letters full of lamentations, the wail\\nof a Titan in pain, superbly exaggerated for literary effect.\\n\\n    Literature, one’s sole craft and staff of life, lies broken in\\n    abeyance; what room for music amid the braying of innumerable\\n    jackasses, the howling of innumerable hyænas whetting the tooth to\\n    eat them up?  Alas for it! it is a sick disjointed time; neither\\n    shall we ever mend it; at best let us hope to mend ourselves.  I\\n    declare I sometimes think of throwing down the Pen altogether as a\\n    worthless weapon; and leading out a colony of these poor starving\\n    Drudges to the waste places of their old Mother Earth, when for sweat\\n    of their brow bread _will_ rise for them; it were perhaps the\\n    worthiest service that at this moment could be rendered our old world\\n    to throw open for it the doors of the New.  Thither must they come at\\n    last, ‘bursts of eloquence’ will do nothing; men are starving and\\n    will try many things before they die.  But poor I, _ach Gott_!  I am\\n    no Hengist or Alaric; only a writer of Articles in bad prose; stick\\n    to thy last, O Tutor; the Pen is not worthless, it is omnipotent to\\n    those who have Faith.\\n\\nHenri Beyle (Stendhal), the great, I am often tempted to think the\\ngreatest of French novelists, writes her a charming letter about\\n_nuances_.  ‘It seems to me,’ he says, ‘that except when they read\\nShakespeare, Byron, or Sterne, no Englishman understands “_nuances_”; we\\nadore them.  A fool says to a woman “I love you”; the words mean nothing,\\nhe might as well say “Olli Batachor”; it is the _nuance_ which gives\\nforce to the meaning.’  In 1839 Mrs. Austin writes to Victor Cousin: ‘I\\nhave seen young Gladstone, a distinguished Tory who wants to re-establish\\neducation based on the Church in quite a Catholic form’; and we find her\\ncorresponding with Mr. Gladstone on the subject of education.  ‘If you\\nare strong enough to provide motives and checks,’ she says to him, ‘you\\nmay do two blessed acts—reform your clergy and teach your people.  As it\\nis, how few of them conceive what it is to teach a people’!  Mr.\\nGladstone replies at great length, and in many letters, from which we may\\nquote this passage:\\n\\n    You are for pressing and urging the people to their profit against\\n    their inclination: so am I.  You set little value upon all merely\\n    technical instruction, upon all that fails to touch the inner nature\\n    of man: so do I.  And here I find ground of union broad and\\n    deep-laid. . . .\\n\\n    I more than doubt whether your idea, namely that of raising man to\\n    social sufficiency and morality, can be accomplished, except through\\n    the ancient religion of Christ; . . . or whether, the principles of\\n    eclecticism are legitimately applicable to the Gospel; or whether, if\\n    we find ourselves in a state of incapacity to work through the\\n    Church, we can remedy the defect by the adoption of principles\\n    contrary to hers. . . .\\n\\n    But indeed I am most unfit to pursue the subject; private\\n    circumstances of no common interest are upon me, as I have become\\n    very recently engaged to Miss Glynne, and I hope your recollections\\n    will enable you in some degree to excuse me.\\n\\nLord Jeffrey has a very curious and suggestive letter on popular\\neducation, in which he denies, or at least doubts, the effect of this\\neducation on morals.  He, however, supports it on the ground ‘that it\\nwill increase the enjoyment of individuals,’ which is certainly a very\\nsensible claim.  Humboldt writes to her about an old Indian language\\nwhich was preserved by a parrot, the tribe who spoke it having been\\nexterminated, and about ‘young Darwin,’ who had just published his first\\nbook.  Here are some extracts from her own letters:\\n\\n    I heard from Lord Lansdowne two or three days ago. . . . I think he\\n    is _ce que nous avons de mieux_.  He wants only the energy that great\\n    ambition gives.  He says, ‘We shall have a parliament of railway\\n    kings’ . . . what can be worse than that?—The deification of money by\\n    a whole people.  As Lord Brougham says, we have no right to give\\n    ourselves pharisaical airs.  I must give you a story sent to me.\\n    Mrs. Hudson, the railway queen, was shown a bust of Marcus Aurelius\\n    at Lord Westminster’s, on which she said, ‘I suppose that is not the\\n    present Marquis.’  To _goûter_ this, you must know that the extreme\\n    vulgar (hackney coachmen, etc.) in England pronounce ‘marquis’ very\\n    like ‘Marcus.’\\n\\n    _Dec._ 17_th_.—Went to Savigny’s.  Nobody was there but W. Grimm and\\n    his wife and a few men.  Grimm told me he had received two volumes of\\n    Norwegian fairy-tales, and that they were delightful.  Talking of\\n    them, I said, ‘Your children appear to be the happiest in the world;\\n    they live in the midst of fairy-tales.’  ‘Ah,’ said he, ‘I must tell\\n    you about that.  When we were at Göttingen, somebody spoke to my\\n    little son about his father’s _Mährchen_.  He had read them but never\\n    thought of their being mine.  He came running to me, and said with an\\n    offended air, “Father, they say you wrote those fairy-tales; surely\\n    you never invented such silly rubbish?”  He thought it below my\\n    dignity.’\\n\\n    Savigny told a _Volksmährchen_ too:\\n\\n    ‘St. Anselm was grown old and infirm, and lay on the ground among\\n    thorns and thistles.  _Der liebe Gott_ said to him, “You are very\\n    badly lodged there; why don’t you build yourself a house?”  “Before I\\n    take the trouble,” said Anselm, “I should like to know how long I\\n    have to live.”  “About thirty years,” said _Der liebe Gott_.  “Oh,\\n    for so short a time,” replied he, “it’s not worth while,” and turned\\n    himself round among the thistles.’\\n\\n    Dr. Franck told me a story of which I had never heard before.\\n    Voltaire had for some reason or other taken a grudge against the\\n    prophet Habakkuk, and affected to find in him things he never wrote.\\n    Somebody took the Bible and began to demonstrate to him that he was\\n    mistaken.  ‘_C’est égal_,’ he said impatiently, ‘_Habakkuk était\\n    capable de tout_!’\\n\\n                                                          _Oct._ 30, 1853.\\n\\n    I am not in love with the _Richtung_ (tendency) of our modern\\n    novelists.  There is abundance of talent; but writing a pretty,\\n    graceful, touching, yet pleasing story is the last thing our writers\\n    nowadays think of.  Their novels are party pamphlets on political or\\n    social questions, like _Sybil_, or _Alton Locke_, or _Mary Barton_,\\n    or _Uncle Tom_; or they are the most minute and painful dissections\\n    of the least agreeable and beautiful parts of our nature, like those\\n    of Miss Brontë—_Jane Eyre_ and _Villette_; or they are a kind of\\n    martyrology, like Mrs. Marsh’s _Emilia Wyndham_, which makes you\\n    almost doubt whether any torments the heroine would have earned by\\n    being naughty could exceed those she incurred by her virtue.\\n\\n    Where, oh! where is the charming, humane, gentle spirit that dictated\\n    the _Vicar of Wakefield_—the spirit which Goethe so justly calls\\n    _versöhnend_ (reconciling), with all the weaknesses and woes of\\n    humanity? . . . Have you read Thackeray’s _Esmond_?  It is a curious\\n    and very successful attempt to imitate the style of our old\\n    novelists. . . .  Which of Mrs. Gore’s novels are translated?  They\\n    are very clever, lively, worldly, bitter, disagreeable, and\\n    entertaining. . . .  Miss Austen’s—are they translated?  They are not\\n    new, and are Dutch paintings of every-day people—very clever, very\\n    true, very _unæsthetic_, but amusing.  I have not seen _Ruth_, by\\n    Mrs. Gaskell.  I hear it much admired—and blamed.  It is one of the\\n    many proofs of the desire women now have to _friser_ questionable\\n    topics, and to _poser_ insoluble moral problems.  George Sand has\\n    turned their heads in that direction.  I think a few _broad_ scenes\\n    or hearty jokes _à la_ Fielding were very harmless in comparison.\\n    They _confounded_ nothing. . . .\\n\\n    The _Heir of Redcliffe_ I have not read. . . . I am not worthy of\\n    superhuman flights of virtue—in a novel.  I want to see how people\\n    act and suffer who are as good-for-nothing as I am myself.  Then I\\n    have the sinful pretension to be amused, whereas all our novelists\\n    want to reform us, and to show us what a hideous place this world is:\\n    _Ma foi_, _je ne le sais que trop_, without their help.\\n\\n    The _Head of the Family_ has some merits. . . . But there is too much\\n    affliction and misery and frenzy.  The heroine is one of those\\n    creatures now so common (in novels), who remind me of a poor bird\\n    tied to a stake (as was once the cruel sport of boys) to be ‘shyed’\\n    at (_i.e._ pelted) till it died; only our gentle lady-writers at the\\n    end of all untie the poor battered bird, and assure us that it is\\n    never the worse for all the blows it has had—nay, the better—and that\\n    now, with its broken wings and torn feathers and bruised body, it is\\n    going to be quite happy.  No, fair ladies, you know that it is not\\n    so—_resigned_, if you please, but make me no shams of happiness out\\n    of such wrecks.\\n\\nIn politics Mrs. Austin was a philosophical Tory.  Radicalism she\\ndetested, and she and most of her friends seem to have regarded it as\\nmoribund.  ‘The Radical party is evidently effete,’ she writes to M.\\nVictor Cousin; the probable ‘leader of the Tory party’ is Mr. Gladstone.\\n‘The people must be instructed, must be guided, must be, in short,\\ngoverned,’ she writes elsewhere; and in a letter to Dr. Whewell, she says\\nthat the state of things in France fills ‘me with the deepest anxiety on\\none point,—the point on which the permanency of our institutions and our\\nsalvation as a nation turn.  Are our higher classes able to keep the lead\\nof the rest?  If they are, we are safe; if not, I agree with my poor dear\\nCharles Buller—_our_ turn must come.  Now Cambridge and Oxford must\\nreally look to this.’  The belief in the power of the Universities to\\nstem the current of democracy is charming.  She grew to regard Carlyle as\\n‘one of the dissolvents of the age—as mischievous as his extravagances\\nwill let him be’; speaks of Kingsley and Maurice as ‘pernicious’; and\\ntalks of John Stuart Mill as a ‘demagogue.’  She was no _doctrinaire_.\\n‘One ounce of education demanded is worth a pound imposed.  It is no use\\nto give the meat before you give the hunger.’  She was delighted at a\\nletter of St. Hilaire’s, in which he said, ‘We have a system and no\\nresults; you have results and no system.’  Yet she had a deep sympathy\\nwith the wants of the people.  She was horrified at something Babbage\\ntold her of the population of some of the manufacturing towns who are\\n_worked out_ before they attain to thirty years of age.  ‘But I am\\npersuaded that the remedy will not, cannot come from the people,’ she\\nadds.  Many of her letters are concerned with the question of the higher\\neducation of women.  She discusses Buckle’s lecture on ‘The Influence of\\nWomen upon the Progress of Knowledge,’ admits to M. Guizot that women’s\\nintellectual life is largely coloured by the emotions, but adds: ‘One is\\nnot precisely a fool because one’s opinions are greatly influenced by\\none’s affections.  The opinions of men are often influenced by worse\\nthings.’  Dr. Whewell consults her about lecturing women on Plato, being\\nslightly afraid lest people should think it ridiculous; Comte writes her\\nelaborate letters on the relation of women to progress; and Mr. Gladstone\\npromises that Mrs. Gladstone will carry out at Hawarden the suggestions\\ncontained in one of her pamphlets.  She was always very practical, and\\nnever lost her admiration for plain sewing.\\n\\nAll through the book we come across interesting and amusing things.  She\\ngets St. Hilaire to order a large, sensible bonnet for her in Paris,\\nwhich was at once christened the ‘Aristotelian,’ and was supposed to be\\nthe only useful bonnet in England.  Grote has to leave Paris after the\\n_coup d’état_, he tells her, because he cannot bear to see the\\nestablishment of a Greek tyrant.  Alfred de Vigny, Macaulay, John\\nStirling, Southey, Alexis de Tocqueville, Hallam, and Jean Jacques Ampère\\nall contribute to these pleasant pages.  She seems to have inspired the\\nwarmest feelings of friendship in those who knew her.  Guizot writes to\\nher: ‘Madame de Staël used to say that the best thing in the world was a\\nserious Frenchman.  I turn the compliment, and say that the best thing in\\nthe world is an affectionate Englishman.  How much more an Englishwoman!\\nGiven equal qualities, a woman is always more charming than a man.’\\n\\nLucie Austin, afterwards Lady Duff Gordon, was born in 1821.  Her chief\\nplayfellow was John Stuart Mill, and Jeremy Bentham’s garden was her\\nplayground.  She was a lovely, romantic child, who was always wanting the\\nflowers to talk to her, and used to invent the most wonderful stories\\nabout animals, of whom she was passionately fond.  In 1834 Mrs. Austin\\ndecided on leaving England, and Sydney Smith wrote his immortal letter to\\nthe little girl:\\n\\n    Lucie, Lucie, my dear child, don’t tear your frock: tearing frocks is\\n    not of itself a proof of genius.  But write as your mother writes,\\n    act as your mother acts: be frank, loyal, affectionate, simple,\\n    honest, and then integrity or laceration of frock is of little\\n    import.  And Lucie, dear child, mind your arithmetic.  You know in\\n    the first sum of yours I ever saw there was a mistake.  You had\\n    carried two (as a cab is licensed to do), and you ought, dear Lucie,\\n    to have carried but one.  Is this a trifle?  What would life be\\n    without arithmetic but a scene of horrors?  You are going to\\n    Boulogne, the city of debts, peopled by men who have never understood\\n    arithmetic.  By the time you return, I shall probably have received\\n    my first paralytic stroke, and shall have lost all recollection of\\n    you.  Therefore I now give you my parting advice—don’t marry anybody\\n    who has not a tolerable understanding and a thousand a year.  And God\\n    bless you, dear child.\\n\\nAt Boulogne she sat next Heine at _table d’hôte_.  ‘He heard me speak\\nGerman to my mother, and soon began to talk to me, and then said, “When\\nyou go back to England, you can tell your friends that you have seen\\nHeinrich Heine.”  I replied, “And who is Heinrich Heine?”  He laughed\\nheartily and took no offence at my ignorance; and we used to lounge on\\nthe end of the pier together, where he told me stories in which fish,\\nmermaids, water-sprites and a very funny old French fiddler with a poodle\\nwere mixed up in the most fanciful manner, sometimes humorous, and very\\noften pathetic, especially when the water-sprites brought him greetings\\nfrom the “Nord See.”  He was . . . so kind to me and so sarcastic to\\nevery one else.’  Twenty years afterwards the little girl whose ‘braune\\nAugen’ Heine had celebrated in his charming poem _Wenn ick an deinem\\nHause_, used to go and see the dying poet in Paris.  ‘It does one good,’\\nhe said to her, ‘to see a woman who does not carry about a broken heart,\\nto be mended by all sorts of men, like the women here, who do not see\\nthat a total want of heart is their real failing.’  On another occasion\\nhe said to her: ‘I have now made peace with the whole world, and at last\\nalso with God, who sends thee to me as a beautiful angel of death: I\\nshall certainly soon die.’  Lady Duff Gordon said to him: ‘Poor Poet, do\\nyou still retain such splendid illusions, that you transform a travelling\\nEnglishwoman into Azrael?  That used not to be the case, for you always\\ndisliked us.’  He answered: ‘Yes, I do not know what possessed me to\\ndislike the English, . . . it really was only petulance; I never hated\\nthem, indeed, I never knew them.  I was only once in England, but knew no\\none, and found London very dreary, and the people and the streets odious.\\nBut England has revenged herself well; she has sent me most excellent\\nfriends—thyself and Milnes, that good Milnes.’\\n\\nThere are delightful letters from Dicky Doyle here, with the most amusing\\ndrawings, one of the present Sir Robert Peel as he made his maiden speech\\nin the House being excellent; and the various descriptions of Hassan’s\\nperformances are extremely amusing.  Hassan was a black boy, who had been\\nturned away by his master because he was going blind, and was found by\\nLady Duff Gordon one night sitting on her doorstep.  She took care of\\nhim, and had him cured, and he seems to have been a constant source of\\ndelight to every one.  On one occasion, ‘when Prince Louis Napoleon (the\\nlate Emperor of the French) came in unexpectedly, he gravely said:\\n“Please, my lady, I ran out and bought twopennyworth of sprats for the\\nPrince, and for the honour of the house.”’  Here is an amusing letter\\nfrom Mrs. Norton:\\n\\n    MY DEAR LUCIE,—We have never thanked you for the _red Pots_, which no\\n    early Christian should be without, and which add that finishing\\n    stroke to the splendour of our demesne, which was supposed to depend\\n    on a roc’s egg, in less intelligent times.  We have now a warm\\n    _Pompeian_ appearance, and the constant contemplation of these\\n    classical objects favours the beauty of the facial line; for what can\\n    be deducted from the great fact, apparent in all the states of\\n    antiquity, that _straight noses_ were the ancient custom, but the\\n    logical assumption that the constant habit of turning up the nose at\\n    unsightly objects—such as the National Gallery and other offensive\\n    and obtrusive things—has produced the modern divergence from the true\\n    and proper line of profile?  I rejoice to think that we ourselves are\\n    exempt.  I attribute this to our love of Pompeian Pots (on account of\\n    the beauty and distinction of this Pot’s shape I spell it with a big\\n    P), which has kept us straight in a world of crookedness.  The\\n    pursuit of profiles under difficulties—how much more rare than a\\n    pursuit of knowledge!  Talk of setting good examples before our\\n    children!  Bah! let us set good Pompeian Pots before our children,\\n    and when they grow up they will not depart from them.\\n\\nLady Duff Gordon’s _Letters from the Cape_, and her brilliant translation\\nof _The Amber Witch_, are, of course, well known.  The latter book was,\\nwith Lady Wilde’s translation of _Sidonia the Sorceress_, my favourite\\nromantic reading when a boy.  Her letters from Egypt are wonderfully\\nvivid and picturesque.  Here is an interesting bit of art criticism:\\n\\n    Sheykh Yoosuf laughed so heartily over a print in an illustrated\\n    paper from a picture of Hilton’s of Rebekah at the well, with the old\\n    ‘wekeel’ of ‘Sidi Ibraheem’ (Abraham’s chief servant) _kneeling_\\n    before the girl he was sent to fetch, like an old fool without his\\n    turban, and Rebekah and the other girls in queer fancy dresses, and\\n    the camels with snouts like pigs.  ‘If the painter could not go into\\n    “Es Sham” to see how the Arab really look,’ said Sheykh Yoosuf, ‘why\\n    did he not paint a well in England, with girls like English\\n    peasants—at least it would have looked natural to English people? and\\n    the wekeel would not seem so like a madman if he had taken off a\\n    hat!’  I cordially agree with Yoosuf’s art criticism.  _Fancy_\\n    pictures of Eastern things are hopelessly absurd.\\n\\nMrs. Ross has certainly produced a most fascinating volume, and her book\\nis one of the books of the season.  It is edited with tact and judgment.\\n\\n_Three Generations of English Women_.  _Memoirs and Correspondence of\\nSusannah Taylor_, _Sarah Austin_, _and Lady Duff Gordon_.  By Janet Ross,\\nauthor of Italian Sketches, Land of Manfred, etc.  (Fisher Unwin.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOETRY AND PRISON\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, January 3, 1889.)\\n\\n\\nPrison has had an admirable effect on Mr. Wilfrid Blunt as a poet.  The\\n_Love Sonnets of Proteus_, in spite of their clever Musset-like\\nmodernities and their swift brilliant wit, were but affected or fantastic\\nat best.  They were simply the records of passing moods and moments, of\\nwhich some were sad and others sweet, and not a few shameful.  Their\\nsubject was not of high or serious import.  They contained much that was\\nwilful and weak.  In _Vinculis_, upon the other hand, is a book that\\nstirs one by its fine sincerity of purpose, its lofty and impassioned\\nthought, its depth and ardour of intense feeling.  ‘Imprisonment,’ says\\nMr. Blunt in his preface, ‘is a reality of discipline most useful to the\\nmodern soul, lapped as it is in physical sloth and self-indulgence.  Like\\na sickness or a spiritual retreat it purifies and ennobles; and the soul\\nemerges from it stronger and more self-contained.’  To him, certainly, it\\nhas been a mode of purification.  The opening sonnets, composed in the\\nbleak cell of Galway Gaol, and written down on the flyleaves of the\\nprisoner’s prayer-book, are full of things nobly conceived and nobly\\nuttered, and show that though Mr. Balfour may enforce ‘plain living’ by\\nhis prison regulations, he cannot prevent ‘high thinking’ or in any way\\nlimit or constrain the freedom of a man’s soul.  They are, of course,\\nintensely personal in expression.  They could not fail to be so.  But the\\npersonality that they reveal has nothing petty or ignoble about it.  The\\npetulant cry of the shallow egoist which was the chief characteristic of\\nthe _Love Sonnets of Proteus_ is not to be found here.  In its place we\\nhave wild grief and terrible scorn, fierce rage and flame-like passion.\\nSuch a sonnet as the following comes out of the very fire of heart and\\nbrain:\\n\\n    God knows, ’twas not with a fore-reasoned plan\\n       I left the easeful dwellings of my peace,\\n    And sought this combat with ungodly Man,\\n       And ceaseless still through years that do not cease\\n       Have warred with Powers and Principalities.\\n    My natural soul, ere yet these strifes began,\\n       Was as a sister diligent to please\\n    And loving all, and most the human clan.\\n\\n    God knows it.  And He knows how the world’s tears\\n       Touched me.  And He is witness of my wrath,\\n    How it was kindled against murderers\\n       Who slew for gold, and how upon their path\\n    I met them.  Since which day the World in arms\\n    Strikes at my life with angers and alarms.\\n\\nAnd this sonnet has all the strange strength of that despair which is but\\nthe prelude to a larger hope:\\n\\n    I thought to do a deed of chivalry,\\n       An act of worth, which haply in her sight\\n    Who was my mistress should recorded be\\n       And of the nations.  And, when thus the fight\\n       Faltered and men once bold with faces white\\n    Turned this and that way in excuse to flee,\\n       I only stood, and by the foeman’s might\\n    Was overborne and mangled cruelly.\\n\\n    Then crawled I to her feet, in whose dear cause\\n       I made this venture, and ‘Behold,’ I said,\\n    ‘How I am wounded for thee in these wars.’\\n       But she, ‘Poor cripple, would’st thou I should wed\\n    A limbless trunk?’ and laughing turned from me.\\n    Yet she was fair, and her name ‘Liberty.’\\n\\nThe sonnet beginning\\n\\n    A prison is a convent without God—\\n       Poverty, Chastity, Obedience\\n    Its precepts are:\\n\\nis very fine; and this, written just after entering the gaol, is\\npowerful:\\n\\n    Naked I came into the world of pleasure,\\n       And naked come I to this house of pain.\\n    Here at the gate I lay down my life’s treasure,\\n       My pride, my garments and my name with men.\\n       The world and I henceforth shall be as twain,\\n    No sound of me shall pierce for good or ill\\n       These walls of grief.  Nor shall I hear the vain\\n    Laughter and tears of those who love me still.\\n\\n    Within, what new life waits me!  Little ease,\\n       Cold lying, hunger, nights of wakefulness,\\n    Harsh orders given, no voice to soothe or please,\\n       Poor thieves for friends, for books rules meaningless;\\n    This is the grave—nay, hell.  Yet, Lord of Might,\\n    Still in Thy light my spirit shall see light.\\n\\nBut, indeed, all the sonnets are worth reading, and _The Canon of\\nAughrim_, the longest poem in the book, is a most masterly and dramatic\\ndescription of the tragic life of the Irish peasant.  Literature is not\\nmuch indebted to Mr. Balfour for his sophistical _Defence of Philosophic\\nDoubt_, which is one of the dullest books we know, but it must be\\nadmitted that by sending Mr. Blunt to gaol he has converted a clever\\nrhymer into an earnest and deep-thinking poet.  The narrow confines of a\\nprison cell seem to suit the ‘sonnet’s scanty plot of ground,’ and an\\nunjust imprisonment for a noble cause strengthens as well as deepens the\\nnature.\\n\\n_In Vinculis_.  By Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, Author of _The Wind and the\\nWhirlwind_, _The Love Sonnets of Proteus_, _etc. etc._  (Kegan Paul.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO WALT WHITMAN\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, January 25, 1889.)\\n\\n\\n‘No one will get to my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary\\nperformance . . . or as aiming mainly towards art and æstheticism.’\\n‘_Leaves of Grass_ . . . has mainly been the outcropping of my own\\nemotional and other personal nature—an attempt, from first to last, to\\nput _a Person_, a human being (myself, in the latter half of the\\nNineteenth Century in America,) freely, fully and truly on record.  I\\ncould not find any similar personal record in current literature that\\nsatisfied me.’  In these words Walt Whitman gives us the true attitude we\\nshould adopt towards his work, having, indeed, a much saner view of the\\nvalue and meaning of that work than either his eloquent admirers or noisy\\ndetractors can boast of possessing.  His last book, _November Boughs_, as\\nhe calls it, published in the winter of the old man’s life, reveals to\\nus, not indeed a soul’s tragedy, for its last note is one of joy and\\nhope, and noble and unshaken faith in all that is fine and worthy of such\\nfaith, but certainly the drama of a human soul, and puts on record with a\\nsimplicity that has in it both sweetness and strength the record of his\\nspiritual development, and of the aim and motive both of the manner and\\nthe matter of his work.  His strange mode of expression is shown in these\\npages to have been the result of deliberate and self-conscious choice.\\nThe ‘barbaric yawp’ which he sent over ‘the roofs of the world’ so many\\nyears ago, and which wrung from Mr. Swinburne’s lip such lofty panegyric\\nin song and such loud clamorous censure in prose, appears here in what\\nwill be to many an entirely new light.  For in his very rejection of art\\nWalt Whitman is an artist.  He tried to produce a certain effect by\\ncertain means and he succeeded.  There is much method in what many have\\ntermed his madness, too much method, indeed, some may be tempted to\\nfancy.\\n\\nIn the story of his life, as he tells it to us, we find him at the age of\\nsixteen beginning a definite and philosophical study of literature:\\n\\n    Summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for a week at a\\n    stretch, down in the country, or to Long Island’s seashores—there, in\\n    the presence of outdoor influences, I went over thoroughly the Old\\n    and New Testaments, and absorb’d (probably to better advantage for me\\n    than in any library or indoor room—it makes such difference _where_\\n    you read) Shakspere, Ossian, the best translated versions I could get\\n    of Homer, Eschylus, Sophocles, the old German Nibelungen, the ancient\\n    Hindoo poems, and one or two other masterpieces, Dante’s among them.\\n    As it happen’d, I read the latter mostly in an old wood.  The _Iliad_\\n    . . . I read first thoroughly on the peninsula of Orient, northeast\\n    end of Long Island, in a shelter’d hollow of rock and sand, with the\\n    sea on each side.  (I have wonder’d since why I was not overwhelm’d\\n    by those mighty masters.  Likely because I read them, as described,\\n    in the full presence of Nature, under the sun, with the far-spreading\\n    landscapes and vistas, or the sea rolling in.)\\n\\nEdgar Allan Poe’s amusing bit of dogmatism that, for our occasions and\\nour day, ‘there can be no such thing as a long poem,’ fascinated him.\\n‘The same thought had been haunting my mind before,’ he said, ‘but Poe’s\\nargument . . . work’d the sum out, and proved it to me,’ and the English\\ntranslation of the Bible seems to have suggested to him the possibility\\nof a poetic form which, while retaining the spirit of poetry, would still\\nbe free from the trammels of rhyme and of a definite metrical system.\\nHaving thus, to a certain degree, settled upon what one might call the\\n‘technique’ of Whitmanism, he began to brood upon the nature of that\\nspirit which was to give life to the strange form.  The central point of\\nthe poetry of the future seemed to him to be necessarily ‘an identical\\nbody and soul, a personality,’ in fact, which personality, he tells us\\nfrankly, ‘after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settled\\nshould be myself.’  However, for the true creation and revealing of this\\npersonality, at first only dimly felt, a new stimulus was needed.  This\\ncame from the Civil War.  After describing the many dreams and passions\\nof his boyhood and early manhood, he goes on to say:\\n\\n    These, however, and much more might have gone on and come to naught\\n    (almost positively would have come to naught,) if a sudden, vast,\\n    terrible, direct and indirect stimulus for new and national\\n    declamatory expression had not been given to me.  It is certain, I\\n    say, that although I had made a start before, only from the\\n    occurrence of the Secession War, and what it show’d me as by flashes\\n    of lightning, with the emotional depths it sounded and arous’d (of\\n    course, I don’t mean in my own heart only, I saw it just as plainly\\n    in others, in millions)—that only from the strong flare and\\n    provocation of that war’s sights and scenes the final\\n    reasons-for-being of an autochthonic and passionate song definitely\\n    came forth.\\n\\n    I went down to the war fields of Virginia . . . lived thenceforward\\n    in camp—saw great battles and the days and nights afterward—partook\\n    of all the fluctuations, gloom, despair, hopes again arous’d, courage\\n    evoked—death readily risk’d—_the cause_, too—along and filling those\\n    agonistic and lurid following years . . . the real parturition years\\n    . . . of this henceforth homogeneous Union.  Without those three or\\n    four years and the experiences they gave, _Leaves of Grass_ would not\\n    now be existing.\\n\\nHaving thus obtained the necessary stimulus for the quickening and\\nawakening of the personal self, some day to be endowed with universality,\\nhe sought to find new notes of song, and, passing beyond the mere passion\\nfor expression, he aimed at ‘Suggestiveness’ first.\\n\\n    I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently\\n    with my scheme.  The reader will have his or her part to do, just as\\n    much as I have had mine.  I seek less to state or display any theme\\n    or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the\\n    theme or thought—there to pursue your own flight.\\n\\nAnother ‘impetus-word’ is Comradeship, and other ‘word-signs’ are Good\\nCheer, Content and Hope.  Individuality, especially, he sought for:\\n\\n    I have allow’d the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear\\n    upon American individuality and assist it—not only because that is a\\n    great lesson in Nature, amid all her generalizing laws, but as\\n    counterpoise to the leveling tendencies of Democracy—and for other\\n    reasons.  Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I\\n    avowedly chant ‘the great pride of man in himself,’ and permit it to\\n    be more or less a _motif_ of nearly all my verse.  I think this pride\\n    is indispensable to an American.  I think it not inconsistent with\\n    obedience, humility, deference, and self-questioning.\\n\\nA new theme also was to be found in the relation of the sexes, conceived\\nin a natural, simple and healthy form, and he protests against poor Mr.\\nWilliam Rossetti’s attempt to Bowdlerise and expurgate his song.\\n\\n    From another point of view _Leaves of Grass_ is avowedly the song of\\n    Sex and Amativeness, and even Animality—though meanings that do not\\n    usually go along with these words are behind all, and will duly\\n    emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and\\n    atmosphere.  Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines,\\n    I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives\\n    breath to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well\\n    have been left unwritten were those lines omitted. . . .\\n\\n    Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities . . .\\n    there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their\\n    normal recognizance.  Literature is always calling in the doctor for\\n    consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing\\n    suppressions in place of that ‘heroic nudity’ on which only a genuine\\n    diagnosis . . . can be built.  And in respect to editions of _Leaves\\n    of Grass_ in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion\\n    now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and\\n    deliberate renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far\\n    as word of mine can do so, any elision of them.\\n\\nBut beyond all these notes and moods and motives is the lofty spirit of a\\ngrand and free acceptance of all things that are worthy of existence.  He\\ndesired, he says, ‘to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should\\ndirectly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom,\\nhealth, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object, every\\nhuman or other existence, not only consider’d from the point of view of\\nall, but of each.’  His two final utterances are that ‘really great\\npoetry is always . . . the result of a national spirit, and not the\\nprivilege of a polish’d and select few’; and that ‘the strongest and\\nsweetest songs yet remain to be sung.’\\n\\nSuch are the views contained in the opening essay _A Backward Glance O’er\\nTravel’d Roads_, as he calls it; but there are many other essays in this\\nfascinating volume, some on poets such as Burns and Lord Tennyson, for\\nwhom Walt Whitman has a profound admiration; some on old actors and\\nsingers, the elder Booth, Forrest, Alboni and Mario being his special\\nfavourites; others on the native Indians, on the Spanish element in\\nAmerican nationality, on Western slang, on the poetry of the Bible, and\\non Abraham Lincoln.  But Walt Whitman is at his best when he is analysing\\nhis own work and making schemes for the poetry of the future.\\nLiterature, to him, has a distinctly social aim.  He seeks to build up\\nthe masses by ‘building up grand individuals.’  And yet literature itself\\nmust be preceded by noble forms of life.  ‘The best literature is always\\nthe result of something far greater than itself—not the hero but the\\nportrait of the hero.  Before there can be recorded history or poem there\\nmust be the transaction.’  Certainly, in Walt Whitman’s views there is a\\nlargeness of vision, a healthy sanity and a fine ethical purpose.  He is\\nnot to be placed with the professional littérateurs of his country,\\nBoston novelists, New York poets and the like.  He stands apart, and the\\nchief value of his work is in its prophecy, not in its performance.  He\\nhas begun a prelude to larger themes.  He is the herald to a new era.  As\\na man he is the precursor of a fresh type.  He is a factor in the heroic\\nand spiritual evolution of the human being.  If Poetry has passed him by,\\nPhilosophy will take note of him.\\n\\n_November Boughs_.  By Walt Whitman.  (Alexander Gardner.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIRISH FAIRY TALES\\n(_Woman’s World_, February 1889.)\\n\\n\\n‘The various collectors of Irish folk-lore,’ says Mr. W. B. Yeats in his\\ncharming little book _Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry_,\\n‘have, from our point of view, one great merit, and from the point of\\nview of others, one great fault.’\\n\\n    They have made their work literature rather than science, and told us\\n    of the Irish peasantry rather than of the primitive religion of\\n    mankind, or whatever else the folk-lorists are on the gad after.  To\\n    be considered scientists they should have tabulated all their tales\\n    in forms like grocers’ bills—item the fairy king, item the queen.\\n    Instead of this they have caught the very voice of the people, the\\n    very pulse of life, each giving what was most noticed in his day.\\n    Croker and Lover, full of the ideas of harum-scarum Irish gentility,\\n    saw everything humorized.  The impulse of the Irish literature of\\n    their time came from a class that did not—mainly for political\\n    reasons—take the populace seriously, and imagined the country as a\\n    humorist’s Arcadia; its passion, its gloom, its tragedy, they knew\\n    nothing of.  What they did was not wholly false; they merely\\n    magnified an irresponsible type, found oftenest among boatmen,\\n    carmen, and gentlemen’s servants, into the type of a whole nation,\\n    and created the stage Irishman.  The writers of ’Forty-eight, and the\\n    famine combined, burst their bubble.  Their work had the dash as well\\n    as the shallowness of an ascendant and idle class, and in Croker is\\n    touched everywhere with beauty—a gentle Arcadian beauty.  Carleton, a\\n    peasant born, has in many of his stories, . . . more especially in\\n    his ghost stories, a much more serious way with him, for all his\\n    humour.  Kennedy, an old bookseller in Dublin, who seems to have had\\n    a something of genuine belief in the fairies, comes next in time.  He\\n    has far less literary faculty, but is wonderfully accurate, giving\\n    often the very words the stories were told in.  But the best book\\n    since Croker is Lady Wilde’s _Ancient __Legends_.  The humour has all\\n    given way to pathos and tenderness.  We have here the innermost heart\\n    of the Celt in the moments he has grown to love through years of\\n    persecution, when, cushioning himself about with dreams, and hearing\\n    fairy-songs in the twilight, he ponders on the soul and on the dead.\\n    Here is the Celt, only it is the Celt dreaming.\\n\\nInto a volume of very moderate dimensions, and of extremely moderate\\nprice, Mr. Yeats has collected together the most characteristic of our\\nIrish folklore stories, grouping them together according to subject.\\nFirst come _The Trooping Fairies_.  The peasants say that these are\\n‘fallen angels who were not good enough to be saved, nor bad enough to be\\nlost’; but the Irish antiquarians see in them ‘the gods of pagan\\nIreland,’ who, ‘when no longer worshipped and fed with offerings,\\ndwindled away in the popular imagination, and now are only a few spans\\nhigh.’  Their chief occupations are feasting, fighting, making love, and\\nplaying the most beautiful music.  ‘They have only one industrious person\\namongst them, the _lepra-caun_—the shoemaker.’  It is his duty to repair\\ntheir shoes when they wear them out with dancing.  Mr. Yeats tells us\\nthat ‘near the village of Ballisodare is a little woman who lived amongst\\nthem seven years.  When she came home she had no toes—she had danced them\\noff.’  On May Eve, every seventh year, they fight for the harvest, for\\nthe best ears of grain belong to them.  An old man informed Mr. Yeats\\nthat he saw them fight once, and that they tore the thatch off a house.\\n‘Had any one else been near they would merely have seen a great wind\\nwhirling everything into the air as it passed.’  When the wind drives the\\nleaves and straws before it, ‘that is the fairies, and the peasants take\\noff their hats and say “God bless them.”’  When they are gay, they sing.\\nMany of the most beautiful tunes of Ireland ‘are only their music, caught\\nup by eavesdroppers.’  No prudent peasant would hum _The Pretty Girl\\nMilking the Cow_ near a fairy rath, ‘for they are jealous, and do not\\nlike to hear their songs on clumsy mortal lips.’  Blake once saw a\\nfairy’s funeral.  But this, as Mr. Yeats points out, must have been an\\nEnglish fairy, for the Irish fairies never die; they are immortal.\\n\\nThen come _The Solitary Fairies_, amongst whom we find the little\\n_Lepracaun_ mentioned above.  He has grown very rich, as he possesses all\\nthe treasure-crocks buried in war-time.  In the early part of this\\ncentury, according to Croker, they used to show in Tipperary a little\\nshoe forgotten by the fairy shoemaker.  Then there are two rather\\ndisreputable little fairies—the _Cluricaun_, who gets intoxicated in\\ngentlemen’s cellars, and the Red Man, who plays unkind practical jokes.\\n‘The _Fear-Gorta_ (Man of Hunger) is an emaciated phantom that goes\\nthrough the land in famine time, begging an alms and bringing good luck\\nto the giver.’  The _Water-sheerie_ is ‘own brother to the English\\nJack-o’-Lantern.’  ‘_The Leanhaun Shee_ (fairy mistress) seeks the love\\nof mortals.  If they refuse, she must be their slave; if they consent,\\nthey are hers, and can only escape by finding another to take their\\nplace.  The fairy lives on their life, and they waste away.  Death is no\\nescape from her.  She is the Gaelic muse, for she gives inspiration to\\nthose she persecutes.  The Gaelic poets die young, for she is restless,\\nand will not let them remain long on earth.’  The _Pooka_ is essentially\\nan animal spirit, and some have considered him the forefather of\\nShakespeare’s ‘Puck.’  He lives on solitary mountains, and among old\\nruins ‘grown monstrous with much solitude,’ and ‘is of the race of the\\nnightmare.’  ‘He has many shapes—is now a horse, . . . now a goat, now an\\neagle.  Like all spirits, he is only half in the world of form.’  The\\n_banshee_ does not care much for our democratic levelling tendencies; she\\nloves only old families, and despises the _parvenu_ or the _nouveau\\nriche_.  When more than one banshee is present, and they wail and sing in\\nchorus, it is for the death of some holy or great one.  An omen that\\nsometimes accompanies the banshee is ‘. . . an immense black coach,\\nmounted by a coffin, and drawn by headless horses driven by a\\n_Dullahan_.’  A _Dullahan_ is the most terrible thing in the world.  In\\n1807 two of the sentries stationed outside St. James’s Park saw one\\nclimbing the railings, and died of fright.  Mr. Yeats suggests that they\\nare possibly ‘descended from that Irish giant who swam across the Channel\\nwith his head in his teeth.’\\n\\nThen come the stories of ghosts, of saints and priests, and of giants.\\nThe ghosts live in a state intermediary between this world and the next.\\nThey are held there by some earthly longing or affection, or some duty\\nunfulfilled, or anger against the living; they are those who are too good\\nfor hell, and too bad for heaven.  Sometimes they ‘take the forms of\\ninsects, especially of butterflies.’  The author of the _Parochial Survey\\nof Ireland_ ‘heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly,\\n“How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather?”  On November\\neve they are abroad, and dance with the fairies.’  As for the saints and\\npriests, ‘there are no martyrs in the stories.’  That ancient chronicler\\nGiraldus Cambrensis ‘taunted the Archbishop of Cashel, because no one in\\nIreland had received the crown of martyrdom.  “Our people may be\\nbarbarous,” the prelate answered, “but they have never lifted their hands\\nagainst God’s saints; but now that a people have come amongst us who know\\nhow to make them (it was just after the English invasion), we shall have\\nmartyrs plentifully.”’  The giants were the old pagan heroes of Ireland,\\nwho grew bigger and bigger, just as the gods grew smaller and smaller.\\nThe fact is they did not wait for offerings; they took them _vi et\\narmis_.\\n\\nSome of the prettiest stories are those that cluster round _Tír-na-n-Og_.\\nThis is the Country of the Young, ‘for age and death have not found it;\\nneither tears nor loud laughter have gone near it.’  ‘One man has gone\\nthere and returned.  The bard, Oisen, who wandered away on a white horse,\\nmoving on the surface of the foam with his fairy Niamh, lived there three\\nhundred years, and then returned looking for his comrades.  The moment\\nhis foot touched the earth his three hundred years fell on him, and he\\nwas bowed double, and his beard swept the ground.  He described his\\nsojourn in the Land of Youth to Patrick before he died.’  Since then,\\naccording to Mr. Yeats, ‘many have seen it in many places; some in the\\ndepths of lakes, and have heard rising therefrom a vague sound of bells;\\nmore have seen it far off on the horizon, as they peered out from the\\nwestern cliffs.  Not three years ago a fisherman imagined that he saw\\nit.’\\n\\nMr. Yeats has certainly done his work very well.  He has shown great\\ncritical capacity in his selection of the stories, and his little\\nintroductions are charmingly written.  It is delightful to come across a\\ncollection of purely imaginative work, and Mr. Yeats has a very quick\\ninstinct in finding out the best and the most beautiful things in Irish\\nfolklore.\\n\\nI am also glad to see that he has not confined himself entirely to prose,\\nbut has included Allingham’s lovely poem on _The Fairies_:\\n\\n    Up the airy mountain,\\n       Down the rushy glen,\\n    We daren’t go a-hunting\\n       For fear of little men;\\n    Wee folk, good folk,\\n       Trooping all together;\\n    Green jacket, red cap,\\n       And white owl’s feather!\\n\\n    Down along the rocky shore\\n       Some make their home,\\n    They live on crispy pancakes\\n       Of yellow tide-foam;\\n    Some in the reeds\\n       Of the black mountain lake,\\n    With frogs for their watch-dogs\\n       All night awake.\\n\\n    High on the hill-top\\n       The old King sits;\\n    He is now so old and gray\\n       He’s nigh lost his wits.\\n    With a bridge of white mist\\n       Columbkill he crosses,\\n    On his stately journeys\\n       From Slieveleague to Rosses;\\n    Or going up with music,\\n       On cold starry nights,\\n    To sup with the Queen\\n       Of the gay Northern Lights.\\n\\nAll lovers of fairy tales and folklore should get this little book.  _The\\nHorned Women_, _The Priest’s Soul_, {157} and _Teig O’Kane_, are really\\nmarvellous in their way; and, indeed, there is hardly a single story that\\nis not worth reading and thinking over.\\n\\n_Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry_.  Edited and Selected by W.\\nB. Yeats.  (Walter Scott.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMR. W. B. YEATS\\n(_Woman’s World_, March 1889.)\\n\\n\\n‘_The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems_ is, I believe, the first\\nvolume of poems that Mr. Yeats has published, and it is certainly full of\\npromise.  It must be admitted that many of the poems are too fragmentary,\\ntoo incomplete.  They read like stray scenes out of unfinished plays,\\nlike things only half remembered, or, at best, but dimly seen.  But the\\narchitectonic power of construction, the power to build up and make\\nperfect a harmonious whole, is nearly always the latest, as it certainly\\nis the highest, development of the artistic temperament.  It is somewhat\\nunfair to expect it in early work.  One quality Mr. Yeats has in a marked\\ndegree, a quality that is not common in the work of our minor poets, and\\nis therefore all the more welcome to us—I mean the romantic temper.  He\\nis essentially Celtic, and his verse, at its best, is Celtic also.\\nStrongly influenced by Keats, he seems to study how to ‘load every rift\\nwith ore,’ yet is more fascinated by the beauty of words than by the\\nbeauty of metrical music.  The spirit that dominates the whole book is\\nperhaps more valuable than any individual poem or particular passage, but\\nthis from _The Wanderings of Oisin_ is worth quoting.  It describes the\\nride to the Island of Forgetfulness:\\n\\n    And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow light,\\n       For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world\\n    and the sun,\\n    Ceased on our hands and faces, on hazel and oak leaf, the light,\\n       And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole of the world\\n    was one;\\n\\n    Till the horse gave a whinny; for cumbrous with stems of the hazel\\n    and oak,\\n       Of hollies, and hazels, and oak-trees, a valley was sloping away\\n    From his hoofs in the heavy grasses, with monstrous slumbering folk,\\n       Their mighty and naked and gleaming bodies heaped loose where they\\n    lay.\\n\\n    More comely than man may make them, inlaid with silver and gold,\\n       Were arrow and shield and war-axe, arrow and spear and blade,\\n    And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollows a child of three years old\\n       Could sleep on a couch of rushes, round and about them laid.\\n\\nAnd this, which deals with the old legend of the city lying under the\\nwaters of a lake, is strange and interesting:\\n\\n    The maker of the stars and worlds\\n       Sat underneath the market cross,\\n    And the old men were walking, walking,\\n       And little boys played pitch-and-toss.\\n\\n    ‘The props,’ said He, ‘of stars and worlds\\n       Are prayers of patient men and good.\\n    The boys, the women, and old men,\\n       Listening, upon their shadows stood.\\n\\n    A grey professor passing cried,\\n       ‘How few the mind’s intemperance rule!\\n    What shallow thoughts about deep things!\\n       The world grows old and plays the fool.’\\n\\n    The mayor came, leaning his left ear—\\n       There were some talking of the poor—\\n    And to himself cried, ‘Communist!’\\n       And hurried to the guardhouse door.\\n\\n    The bishop came with open book,\\n       Whispering along the sunny path;\\n    There was some talking of man’s God,\\n       His God of stupor and of wrath.\\n\\n    The bishop murmured, ‘Atheist!\\n       How sinfully the wicked scoff!’\\n    And sent the old men on their way,\\n       And drove the boys and women off.\\n\\n    The place was empty now of people;\\n       A cock came by upon his toes;\\n    An old horse looked across the fence,\\n       And rubbed along the rail his nose.\\n\\n    The maker of the stars and worlds\\n       To His own house did Him betake,\\n    And on that city dropped a tear,\\n       And now that city is a lake.\\n\\nMr. Yeats has a great deal of invention, and some of the poems in his\\nbook, such as _Mosada_, _Jealousy_, and _The Island of Statues_, are very\\nfinely conceived.  It is impossible to doubt, after reading his present\\nvolume, that he will some day give us work of high import.  Up to this he\\nhas been merely trying the strings of his instrument, running over the\\nkeys.\\n\\n_The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems_.  By W. B. Yeats.  (Kegan\\nPaul.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMR. YEATS’S _WANDERINGS OF OISIN_\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, July 12, 1889.)\\n\\n\\nBooks of poetry by young writers are usually promissory notes that are\\nnever met.  Now and then, however, one comes across a volume that is so\\nfar above the average that one can hardly resist the fascinating\\ntemptation of recklessly prophesying a fine future for its author.  Such\\na book Mr. Yeats’s _Wanderings of Oisin_ certainly is.  Here we find\\nnobility of treatment and nobility of subject-matter, delicacy of poetic\\ninstinct and richness of imaginative resource.  Unequal and uneven much\\nof the work must be admitted to be.  Mr. Yeats does not try to ‘out-baby’\\nWordsworth, we are glad to say; but he occasionally succeeds in\\n‘out-glittering’ Keats, and, here and there, in his book we come across\\nstrange crudities and irritating conceits.  But when he is at his best he\\nis very good.  If he has not the grand simplicity of epic treatment, he\\nhas at least something of the largeness of vision that belongs to the\\nepical temper.  He does not rob of their stature the great heroes of\\nCeltic mythology.  He is very naïve and very primitive and speaks of his\\ngiants with the air of a child.  Here is a characteristic passage from\\nthe account of Oisin’s return from the Island of Forgetfulness:\\n\\n    And I rode by the plains of the sea’s edge, where all is barren and\\n    grey,\\n       Grey sands on the green of the grasses and over the dripping\\n    trees,\\n    Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away\\n       Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the\\n    seas.\\n\\n    Long fled the foam-flakes around me, the winds fled out of the vast,\\n       Snatching the bird in secret, nor knew I, embosomed apart,\\n    When they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast,\\n       For Remembrance, lifting her leanness, keened in the gates of my\\n    heart.\\n\\n    Till fattening the winds of the morning, an odour of new-mown hay\\n       Came, and my forehead fell low, and my tears like berries fell\\n    down;\\n    Later a sound came, half lost in the sound of a shore far away,\\n       From the great grass-barnacle calling, and later the shore-winds\\n    brown.\\n\\n    If I were as I once was, the gold hooves crushing the sand and the\\n    shells,\\n       Coming forth from the sea like the morning with red lips murmuring\\n    a song,\\n    Not coughing, my head on my knees, and praying, and wroth with the\\n    bells,\\n       I would leave no Saint’s head on his body, though spacious his\\n    lands were and strong.\\n\\n    Making way from the kindling surges, I rode on a bridle-path,\\n       Much wondering to see upon all hands, of wattle and woodwork made,\\n    Thy bell-mounted churches, and guardless the sacred cairn and the\\n    earth,\\n       And a small and feeble populace stooping with mattock and spade.\\n\\nIn one or two places the music is faulty, the construction is sometimes\\ntoo involved, and the word ‘populace’ in the last line is rather\\ninfelicitous; but, when all is said, it is impossible not to feel in\\nthese stanzas the presence of the true poetic spirit.\\n\\n_The Wanderings of Oisin and other Poems_.  By W. B. Yeats.  (Kegan\\nPaul.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMR. WILLIAM MORRIS’S LAST BOOK\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, March 2, 1889.)\\n\\n\\nMr. Morris’s last book is a piece of pure art workmanship from beginning\\nto end, and the very remoteness of its style from the common language and\\nordinary interests of our day gives to the whole story a strange beauty\\nand an unfamiliar charm.  It is written in blended prose and verse, like\\nthe mediæval ‘cante-fable,’ and tells the tale of the House of the\\nWolfings in its struggles against the legionaries of Rome then advancing\\ninto Northern Germany.  It is a kind of Saga, and the language in which\\nthe folk-epic, as we may call it, is set forth recalls the antique\\ndignity and directness of our English tongue four centuries ago.  From an\\nartistic point of view it may be described as an attempt to return by a\\nself-conscious effort to the conditions of an earlier and a fresher age.\\nAttempts of this kind are not uncommon in the history of art.  From some\\nsuch feeling came the Pre-Raphaelite movement of our own day and the\\narchaistic movement of later Greek sculpture.  When the result is\\nbeautiful the method is justified, and no shrill insistence upon a\\nsupposed necessity for absolute modernity of form can prevail against the\\nvalue of work that has the incomparable excellence of style.  Certainly,\\nMr. Morris’s work possesses this excellence.  His fine harmonies and rich\\ncadences create in the reader that spirit by which alone can its own\\nspirit be interpreted, awake in him something of the temper of romance\\nand, by taking him out of his own age, place him in a truer and more\\nvital relation to the great masterpieces of all time.  It is a bad thing\\nfor an age to be always looking in art for its own reflection.  It is\\nwell that, now and then, we are given work that is nobly imaginative in\\nits method and purely artistic in its aim.  As we read Mr. Morris’s story\\nwith its fine alternations of verse and prose, its decorative and\\ndescriptive beauties, its wonderful handling of romantic and adventurous\\nthemes, we cannot but feel that we are as far removed from the ignoble\\nfiction as we are from the ignoble facts of our own day.  We breathe a\\npurer air, and have dreams of a time when life had a kind of poetical\\nquality of its own, and was simple and stately and complete.\\n\\nThe tragic interest of _The House of the Wolfings_ centres round the\\nfigure of Thiodolf, the great hero of the tribe.  The goddess who loves\\nhim gives him, as he goes to battle against the Romans, a magical hauberk\\non which rests this strange fate: that he who wears it shall save his own\\nlife and destroy the life of his land.  Thiodolf, finding out this\\nsecret, brings the hauberk back to the Wood-Sun, as she is called, and\\nchooses death for himself rather than the ruin of his cause, and so the\\nstory ends.\\n\\nBut Mr. Morris has always preferred romance to tragedy, and set the\\ndevelopment of action above the concentration of passion.  His story is\\nlike some splendid old tapestry crowded with stately images and enriched\\nwith delicate and delightful detail.  The impression it leaves on us is\\nnot of a single central figure dominating the whole, but rather of a\\nmagnificent design to which everything is subordinated, and by which\\neverything becomes of enduring import.  It is the whole presentation of\\nthe primitive life that really fascinates.  What in other hands would\\nhave been mere archæology is here transformed by quick artistic instinct\\nand made wonderful for us, and human and full of high interest.  The\\nancient world seems to have come to life again for our pleasure.\\n\\nOf a work so large and so coherent, completed with no less perfection\\nthan it is conceived, it is difficult by mere quotation to give any\\nadequate idea.  This, however, may serve as an example of its narrative\\npower.  The passage describes the visit of Thiodolf to the Wood-Sun:\\n\\n    The moonlight lay in a great flood on the grass without, and the dew\\n    was falling in the coldest hour of the night, and the earth smelled\\n    sweetly: the whole habitation was asleep now, and there was no sound\\n    to be known as the sound of any creature, save that from the distant\\n    meadow came the lowing of a cow that had lost her calf, and that a\\n    white owl was flitting about near the eaves of the Roof with her wild\\n    cry that sounded like the mocking of merriment now silent.  Thiodolf\\n    turned toward the wood, and walked steadily through the scattered\\n    hazel-trees, and thereby into the thick of the beech-trees, whose\\n    boles grew smooth and silver-grey, high and close-set: and so on and\\n    on he went as one going by a well-known path, though there was no\\n    path, till all the moonlight was quenched under the close roof of the\\n    beech-leaves, though yet for all the darkness, no man could go there\\n    and not feel that the roof was green above him.  Still he went on in\\n    despite of the darkness, till at last there was a glimmer before him,\\n    that grew greater till he came unto a small wood-lawn whereon the\\n    turf grew again, though the grass was but thin, because little\\n    sunlight got to it, so close and thick were the tall trees round\\n    about it. . . . Nought looked Thiodolf either at the heavens above,\\n    or the trees, as he strode from off the husk-strewn floor of the\\n    beech wood on to the scanty grass of the lawn, but his eyes looked\\n    straight before him at that which was amidmost of the lawn: and\\n    little wonder was that; for there on a stone chair sat a woman\\n    exceeding fair, clad in glittering raiment, her hair lying as pale in\\n    the moonlight on the grey stone as the barley acres in the August\\n    night before the reaping-hook goes in amongst them.  She sat there as\\n    though she were awaiting some one, and he made no stop nor stay, but\\n    went straight up to her, and took her in his arms, and kissed her\\n    mouth and her eyes, and she him again; and then he sat himself down\\n    beside her.\\n\\nAs an example of the beauty of the verse we would take this from the song\\nof the Wood-Sun.  It at least shows how perfectly the poetry harmonizes\\nwith the prose, and how natural the transition is from the one to the\\nother:\\n\\n    In many a stead Doom dwelleth, nor sleepeth day nor night:\\n    The rim of the bowl she kisseth, and beareth the chambering light\\n    When the kings of men wend happy to the bride-bed from the board.\\n    It is little to say that she wendeth the edge of the grinded sword,\\n    When about the house half builded she hangeth many a day;\\n    The ship from the strand she shoveth, and on his wonted way\\n    By the mountain hunter fareth where his foot ne’er failed before:\\n    She is where the high bank crumbles at last on the river’s shore:\\n    The mower’s scythe she whetteth; and lulleth the shepherd to sleep\\n    Where the deadly ling-worm wakeneth in the desert of the sheep.\\n    Now we that come of the God-kin of her redes for ourselves we wot,\\n    But her will with the lives of men-folk and their ending know we not.\\n    So therefore I bid thee not fear for thyself of Doom and her deed.\\n    But for me: and I bid thee hearken to the helping of my need.\\n    Or else—Art thou happy in life, or lusteth thou to die\\n    In the flower of thy days, when thy glory and thy longing bloom on\\n    high?\\n\\nThe last chapter of the book in which we are told of the great feast made\\nfor the dead is so finely written that we cannot refrain from quoting\\nthis passage:\\n\\n    Now was the glooming falling upon the earth; but the Hall was bright\\n    within even as the Hall-Sun had promised.  Therein was set forth the\\n    Treasure of the Wolfings; fair cloths were hung on the walls, goodly\\n    broidered garments on the pillars: goodly brazen cauldrons and\\n    fair-carven chests were set down in nooks where men could see them\\n    well, and vessels of gold and silver were set all up and down the\\n    tables of the feast.  The pillars also were wreathed with flowers,\\n    and flowers hung garlanded from the walls over the precious hangings;\\n    sweet gums and spices were burning in fair-wrought censers of brass,\\n    and so many candles were alight under the Roof, that scarce had it\\n    looked more ablaze when the Romans had litten the faggots therein for\\n    its burning amidst the hurry of the Morning Battle.\\n\\n    There then they fell to feasting, hallowing in the high-tide of their\\n    return with victory in their hands: and the dead corpses of Thiodolf\\n    and Otter, clad in precious glittering raiment, looked down on them\\n    from the High-seat, and the kindreds worshipped them and were glad;\\n    and they drank the Cup to them before any others, were they Gods or\\n    men.\\n\\nIn days of uncouth realism and unimaginative imitation, it is a high\\npleasure to welcome work of this kind.  It is a work in which all lovers\\nof literature cannot fail to delight.\\n\\n_A Tale of the House of the Wolfings and all the Kindreds of the Mark_.\\nWritten in Prose and in Verse by William Morris.  (Reeves and Turner.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSOME LITERARY NOTES\\n(_Woman’s World_, April 1889.)\\n\\n\\n‘In modern life,’ said Matthew Arnold once, ‘you cannot well enter a\\nmonastery; but you can enter the Wordsworth Society.’  I fear that this\\nwill sound to many a somewhat uninviting description of this admirable\\nand useful body, whose papers and productions have been recently\\npublished by Professor Knight, under the title of _Wordsworthiana_.\\n‘Plain living and high thinking’ are not popular ideals.  Most people\\nprefer to live in luxury, and to think with the majority.  However, there\\nis really nothing in the essays and addresses of the Wordsworth Society\\nthat need cause the public any unnecessary alarm; and it is gratifying to\\nnote that, although the society is still in the first blush of\\nenthusiasm, it has not yet insisted upon our admiring Wordsworth’s\\ninferior work.  It praises what is worthy of praise, reverences what\\nshould be reverenced, and explains what does not require explanation.\\nOne paper is quite delightful; it is from the pen of Mr. Rawnsley, and\\ndeals with such reminiscences of Wordsworth as still linger among the\\npeasantry of Westmoreland.  Mr. Rawnsley grew up, he tells us, in the\\nimmediate vicinity of the present Poet-Laureate’s old home in\\nLincolnshire, and had been struck with the swiftness with which,\\n\\n    As year by year the labourer tills\\n    His wonted glebe, or lops the glades,\\n\\nthe memories of the poet of the Somersby Wold had ‘faded from off the\\ncircle of the hills’—had, indeed, been astonished to note how little real\\ninterest was taken in him or his fame, and how seldom his works were met\\nwith in the houses of the rich or poor in the very neighbourhood.\\nAccordingly, when he came to reside in the Lake Country, he endeavoured\\nto find out what of Wordsworth’s memory among the men of the Dales still\\nlingered on—how far he was still a moving presence among them—how far his\\nworks had made their way into the cottages and farmhouses of the valleys.\\nHe also tried to discover how far the race of Westmoreland and Cumberland\\nfarm-folk—the ‘Matthews’ and the ‘Michaels’ of the poet, as described by\\nhim—were real or fancy pictures, or how far the characters of the\\nDalesmen had been altered in any remarkable manner by tourist influences\\nduring the thirty-two years that have passed since the Lake poet was laid\\nto rest.\\n\\nWith regard to the latter point, it will be remembered that Mr. Ruskin,\\nwriting in 1876, said that ‘the Border peasantry, painted with absolute\\nfidelity by Scott and Wordsworth,’ are, as hitherto, a scarcely injured\\nrace; that in his fields at Coniston he had men who might have fought\\nwith Henry V. at Agincourt without being distinguished from any of his\\nknights; that he could take his tradesmen’s word for a thousand pounds,\\nand need never latch his garden gate; and that he did not fear\\nmolestation, in wood or on moor, for his girl guests.  Mr. Rawnsley,\\nhowever, found that a certain beauty had vanished which the simple\\nretirement of old valley days fifty years ago gave to the men among whom\\nWordsworth lived.  ‘The strangers,’ he says, ‘with their gifts of gold,\\ntheir vulgarity, and their requirements, have much to answer for.’  As\\nfor their impressions of Wordsworth, to understand them one must\\nunderstand the vernacular of the Lake District.  ‘What was Mr. Wordsworth\\nlike in personal appearance?’ said Mr. Rawnsley once to an old retainer,\\nwho still lives not far from Rydal Mount.  ‘He was a ugly-faäced man, and\\na meän-liver,’ was the answer; but all that was really meant was that he\\nwas a man of marked features, and led a very simple life in matters of\\nfood and raiment.  Another old man, who believed that Wordsworth ‘got\\nmost of his poetry out of Hartley,’ spoke of the poet’s wife as ‘a very\\nonpleasant woman, very onpleasant indeed.  A close-fisted woman, that’s\\nwhat she was.’  This, however, seems to have been merely a tribute to\\nMrs. Wordsworth’s admirable housekeeping qualities.\\n\\nThe first person interviewed by Mr. Rawnsley was an old lady who had been\\nonce in service at Rydal Mount, and was, in 1870, a lodging-house keeper\\nat Grasmere.  She was not a very imaginative person, as may be gathered\\nfrom the following anecdote:—Mr. Rawnsley’s sister came in from a late\\nevening walk, and said, ‘O Mrs. D---, have you seen the wonderful\\nsunset?’  The good lady turned sharply round and, drawing herself to her\\nfull height, as if mortally offended, answered: ‘No, miss; I’m a tidy\\ncook, I know, and “they say” a decentish body for a landlady, but I don’t\\nknaw nothing about sunsets or them sort of things, they’ve never been in\\nmy line.’  Her reminiscence of Wordsworth was as worthy of tradition as\\nit was explanatory, from her point of view, of the method in which\\nWordsworth composed, and was helped in his labours by his enthusiastic\\nsister.  ‘Well, you know,’ she said, ‘Mr. Wordsworth went humming and\\nbooing about, and she, Miss Dorothy, kept close behint him, and she\\npicked up the bits as he let ’em fall, and tak’ ’em down, and put ’em\\ntogether on paper for him.  And you may be very well sure as how she\\ndidn’t understand nor make sense out of ’em, and I doubt that he didn’t\\nknow much about them either himself, but, howivver, there’s a great many\\nfolk as do, I dare say.’  Of Wordsworth’s habit of talking to himself,\\nand composing aloud, we hear a great deal.  ‘Was Mr. Wordsworth a\\nsociable man?’ asked Mr. Rawnsley of a Rydal farmer.  ‘Wudsworth, for a’\\nhe had noa pride nor nowt,’ was the answer, ‘was a man who was quite one\\nto hissel, ye kna.  He was not a man as folks could crack wi’, nor not a\\nman as could crack wi’ folks.  But there was another thing as kep’ folk\\noff, he had a ter’ble girt deep voice, and ye might see his faace agaan\\nfor long enuff.  I’ve knoan folks, village lads and lasses, coming over\\nby old road above, which runs from Grasmere to Rydal, flayt a’most to\\ndeath there by Wishing Gaate to hear the girt voice a groanin’ and\\nmutterin’ and thunderin’ of a still evening.  And he had a way of\\nstandin’ quite still by the rock there in t’ path under Rydal, and folks\\ncould hear sounds like a wild beast coming from the rocks, and childer\\nwere scared fit to be dead a’most.’\\n\\nWordsworth’s description of himself constantly recurs to one:\\n\\n    And who is he with modest looks,\\n       And clad in sober russet gown?\\n    He murmurs by the running brooks,\\n       A music sweeter than their own;\\n    He is retired as noontide dew,\\n    Or fountain in a noonday grove.\\n\\nBut the corroboration comes in strange guise.  Mr. Rawnsley asked one of\\nthe Dalesmen about Wordsworth’s dress and habits.  This was the reply:\\n‘Wudsworth wore a Jem Crow, never seed him in a boxer in my life,—a Jem\\nCrow and an old blue cloak was his rig, and _as for his habits_, _he had\\nnoan_; niver knew him with a pot i’ his hand, or a pipe i’ his mouth.\\nBut he was a greät skater, for a’ that—noan better in these parts—why, he\\ncould cut his own naäme upo’ the ice, could Mr. Wudsworth.’  Skating\\nseems to have been Wordsworth’s one form of amusement.  He was ‘over\\nfeckless i’ his hands’—could not drive or ride—‘not a bit of fish in\\nhim,’ and ‘nowt of a mountaineer.’  But he could skate.  The rapture of\\nthe time when, as a boy, on Esthwaite’s frozen lake, he had\\n\\n             wheeled about,\\n    Proud and exulting like an untired horse\\n    That cares not for his home, and, shod with steel,\\n    Had hissed along the polished ice,\\n\\nwas continued, Mr. Rawnsley tells us, into manhood’s later day; and Mr.\\nRawnsley found many proofs that the skill the poet had gained, when\\n\\n    Not seldom from the uproar he retired,\\n    Into a silent bay, or sportively\\n    Glanced sideways, leaving the tumultuous throng\\n    To cut across the reflex of a star,\\n\\nwas of such a kind as to astonish the natives among whom he dwelt.  The\\nrecollection of a fall he once had, when his skate caught on a stone,\\nstill lingers in the district.  A boy had been sent to sweep the snow\\nfrom the White Moss Tarn for him.  ‘Did Mr. Wudsworth gie ye owt?’ he was\\nasked, when he returned from his labour.  ‘Na, but I seed him tumlle,\\nthough!’ was the answer.  ‘He was a ter’ble girt skater, was Wudsworth\\nnow,’ says one of Mr. Rawnsley’s informants; ‘he would put one hand i’\\nhis breast (he wore a frill shirt i’ them days), and t’ other hand i’ his\\nwaistband, same as shepherds does to keep their hands warm, and he would\\nstand up straight and sway and swing away grandly.’\\n\\nOf his poetry they did not think much, and whatever was good in it they\\nascribed to his wife, his sister, and Hartley Coleridge.  He wrote\\npoetry, they said, ‘because he couldn’t help it—because it was his\\nhobby’—for sheer love, and not for money.  They could not understand his\\ndoing work ‘for nowt,’ and held his occupation in somewhat light esteem\\nbecause it did not bring in ‘a deal o’ brass to the pocket.’  ‘Did you\\never read his poetry, or see any books about in the farmhouses?’ asked\\nMr. Rawnsley.  The answer was curious: ‘Ay, ay, time or two.  But ya’re\\nweel aware there’s potry and potry.  There’s potry wi’ a li’le bit\\npleasant in it, and potry sic as a man can laugh at or the childer\\nunderstand, and some as takes a deal of mastery to make out what’s said,\\nand a deal of Wudsworth’s was this sort, ye kna.  You could tell fra the\\nman’s faace his potry would niver have no laugh in it.  His potry was\\nquite different work from li’le Hartley.  Hartley ’ud goa running along\\nbeside o’ the brooks and mak his, and goa in the first oppen door and\\nwrite what he had got upo’ paper.  But Wudsworth’s potry was real hard\\nstuff, and bided a deal of makking, and he’d keep it in his head for long\\nenough.  Eh, but it’s queer, mon, different ways folks hes of making\\npotry now. . . .  Not but what Mr. Wudsworth didn’t stand very high, and\\nwas a well-spoken man enough.’  The best criticism on Wordsworth that Mr.\\nRawnsley heard was this: ‘He was an open-air man, and a great critic of\\ntrees.’\\n\\nThere are many useful and well-written essays in Professor Knight’s\\nvolume, but Mr. Rawnsley’s is far the most interesting of all.  It gives\\nus a graphic picture of the poet as he appeared in outward semblance and\\nmanner to those about whom he wrote.\\n\\n_Wordsworthiana_: _A Selection from Papers read to the Wordsworth\\nSociety_.

SWINBURNE’S _POEMS AND BALLADS_ (THIRD SERIES)\\n(_Pall Mall Gazette_, June 27, 1889.)\\n\\n\\nMr. Swinburne once set his age on fire by a volume of very perfect and\\nvery poisonous poetry.  Then he became revolutionary and pantheistic, and\\ncried out against those that sit in high places both in heaven and on\\nearth.  Then he invented Marie Stuart and laid upon us the heavy burden\\nof _Bothwell_.  Then he retired to the nursery and wrote poems about\\nchildren of a somewhat over-subtle character.  He is now extremely\\npatriotic, and manages to combine with his patriotism a strong affection\\nfor the Tory party.  He has always been a great poet.  But he has his\\nlimitations, the chief of which is, curiously enough, the entire lack of\\nany sense of limit.  His song is nearly always too loud for his subject.\\nHis magnificent rhetoric, nowhere more magnificent than in the volume\\nthat now lies before us, conceals rather than reveals.  It has been said\\nof him, and with truth, that he is a master of language, but with still\\ngreater truth it may be said that Language is his master.  Words seem to\\ndominate him.  Alliteration tyrannizes over him.  Mere sound often\\nbecomes his lord.  He is so eloquent that whatever he touches becomes\\nunreal.\\n\\nLet us turn to the poem on the Armada:\\n\\n    The wings of the south-west wind are widened; the breath of his\\n    fervent lips,\\n    More keen than a sword’s edge, fiercer than fire, falls full on the\\n    plunging ships.\\n    The pilot is he of the northward flight, their stay and their\\n    steersman he;\\n    A helmsman clothed with the tempest, and girdled with strength to\\n    constrain the sea.\\n    And the host of them trembles and quails, caught fast in his hand as\\n    a bird in the toils:\\n    For the wrath and the joy that fulfil him are mightier than man’s,\\n    whom he slays and spoils.\\n    And vainly, with heart divided in sunder, and labour of wavering\\n    will,\\n    The lord of their host takes counsel with hope if haply their star\\n    shine still.\\n\\nSomehow we seem to have heard all this before.  Does it come from the\\nfact that of all the poets who ever lived Mr. Swinburne is the one who is\\nthe most limited in imagery?  It must be admitted that he is so.  He has\\nwearied us with his monotony.  ‘Fire’ and the ‘Sea’ are the two words\\never on his lips.  We must confess also that this shrill\\nsinging—marvellous as it is—leaves us out of breath.  Here is a passage\\nfrom a poem called _A Word with the Wind_:\\n\\n    Be the sunshine bared or veiled, the sky superb or shrouded,\\n       Still the waters, lax and languid, chafed and foiled,\\n    Keen and thwarted, pale and patient, clothed with fire or clouded,\\n       Vex their heart in vain, or sleep like serpents coiled.\\n    Thee they look for, blind and baffled, wan with wrath and weary,\\n       Blown for ever back by winds that rock the bird:\\n    Winds that seamews breast subdue the sea, and bid the dreary\\n       Waves be weak as hearts made sick with hope deferred.\\n    Let the clarion sound from westward, let the south bear token\\n       How the glories of thy godhead sound and shine:\\n    Bid the land rejoice to see the land-wind’s broad wings broken,\\n       Bid the sea take comfort, bid the world be thine.\\n\\nVerse of this kind may be justly praised for the sustained strength and\\nvigour of its metrical scheme.  Its purely technical excellence is\\nextraordinary.  But is it more than an oratorical _tour de force_?  Does\\nit really convey much?  Does it charm?  Could we return to it again and\\nagain with renewed pleasure?  We think not.  It seems to us empty.\\n\\nOf course, we must not look to these poems for any revelation of human\\nlife.  To be at one with the elements seems to be Mr. Swinburne’s aim.\\nHe seeks to speak with the breath of wind and wave.  The roar of the fire\\nis ever in his ears.  He puts his clarion to the lips of Spring and bids\\nher blow, and the Earth wakes from her dreams and tells him her secret.\\nHe is the first lyric poet who has tried to make an absolute surrender of\\nhis own personality, and he has succeeded.  We hear the song, but we\\nnever know the singer.  We never even get near to him.  Out of the\\nthunder and splendour of words he himself says nothing.  We have often\\nhad man’s interpretation of Nature; now we have Nature’s interpretation\\nof man, and she has curiously little to say.  Force and Freedom form her\\nvague message.  She deafens us with her clangours.\\n\\nBut Mr. Swinburne is not always riding the whirlwind and calling out of\\nthe depths of the sea.  Romantic ballads in Border dialect have not lost\\ntheir fascination for him, and this last volume contains some very\\nsplendid examples of this curious artificial kind of poetry.  The amount\\nof pleasure one gets out of dialect is a matter entirely of temperament.\\nTo say ‘mither’ instead of ‘mother’ seems to many the acme of romance.\\nThere are others who are not quite so ready to believe in the pathos of\\nprovincialism.  There is, however, no doubt of Mr. Swinburne’s mastery\\nover the form, whether the form be quite legitimate or not.  _The __Weary\\nWedding_ has the concentration and colour of a great drama, and the\\nquaintness of its style lends it something of the power of a grotesque.\\nThe ballad of _The Witch-Mother_, a mediæval Medea who slays her children\\nbecause her lord is faithless, is worth reading on account of its\\nhorrible simplicity.  _The Bride’s Tragedy_, with its strange refrain of\\n\\n    In, in, out and in,\\n    Blaws the wind and whirls the whin:\\n\\nThe _Jacobite’s Exile_—\\n\\n    O lordly flow the Loire and Seine,\\n       And loud the dark Durance:\\n    But bonnier shine the braes of Tyne\\n       Than a’ the fields of France;\\n    And the waves of Till that speak sae still\\n       Gleam goodlier where they glance:\\n\\n_The Tyneside Widow_ and _A Reiver’s Neck-verse_ are all poems of fine\\nimaginative power, and some of them are terrible in their fierce\\nintensity of passion.  There is no danger of English poetry narrowing\\nitself to a form so limited as the romantic ballad in dialect.  It is of\\ntoo vital a growth for that.  So we may welcome Mr. Swinburne’s masterly\\nexperiments with the hope that things which are inimitable will not be\\nimitated.  The collection is completed by a few poems on children, some\\nsonnets, a threnody on John William Inchbold, and a lovely lyric entitled\\n_The Interpreters_.\\n\\n    In human thought have all things habitation;\\n             Our days\\n    Laugh, lower, and lighten past, and find no station\\n             That stays.\\n\\n    But thought and faith are mightier things than time\\n             Can wrong,\\n    Made splendid once by speech, or made sublime\\n             By song.\\n\\n    Remembrance, though the tide of change that rolls\\n             Wax hoary,\\n    Gives earth and heaven, for song’s sake and the soul’s,\\n             Their glory.\\n\\nCertainly, ‘for song’s sake’ we should love Mr. Swinburne’s work, cannot,\\nindeed, help loving it, so marvellous a music-maker is he.  But what of\\nthe soul?  For the soul we must go elsewhere.\\n\\n_Poems and Ballads_.  Third Series.  By Algernon Charles Swinburne.\\n(Chatto and Windus.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA CHINESE SAGE\\n(_Speaker_, February 8, 1890.)\\n\\n\\nAn eminent Oxford theologian once remarked that his only objection to\\nmodern progress was that it progressed forward instead of backward—a view\\nthat so fascinated a certain artistic undergraduate that he promptly\\nwrote an essay upon some unnoticed analogies between the development of\\nideas and the movements of the common sea-crab.  I feel sure the\\n_Speaker_ will not be suspected even by its most enthusiastic friends of\\nholding this dangerous heresy of retrogression.  But I must candidly\\nadmit that I have come to the conclusion that the most caustic criticism\\nof modern life I have met with for some time is that contained in the\\nwritings of the learned Chuang Tzŭ, recently translated into the vulgar\\ntongue by Mr. Herbert Giles, Her Majesty’s Consul at Tamsui.\\n\\nThe spread of popular education has no doubt made the name of this great\\nthinker quite familiar to the general public, but, for the sake of the\\nfew and the over-cultured, I feel it my duty to state definitely who he\\nwas, and to give a brief outline of the character of his philosophy.\\n\\nChuang Tzŭ, whose name must carefully be pronounced as it is not written,\\nwas born in the fourth century before Christ, by the banks of the Yellow\\nRiver, in the Flowery Land; and portraits of the wonderful sage seated on\\nthe flying dragon of contemplation may still be found on the simple\\ntea-trays and pleasing screens of many of our most respectable suburban\\nhouseholds.  The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt\\noften mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed\\nover the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him.  If\\nthey really knew who he was, they would tremble.  Chuang Tzŭ spent his\\nlife in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the\\nuselessness of all useful things.  ‘Do nothing, and everything will be\\ndone,’ was the doctrine which he inherited from his great master Lao Tzŭ.\\nTo resolve action into thought, and thought into abstraction, was his\\nwicked transcendental aim.  Like the obscure philosopher of early Greek\\nspeculation, he believed in the identity of contraries; like Plato, he\\nwas an idealist, and had all the idealist’s contempt for utilitarian\\nsystems; he was a mystic like Dionysius, and Scotus Erigena, and Jacob\\nBöhme, and held, with them and with Philo, that the object of life was to\\nget rid of self-consciousness, and to become the unconscious vehicle of a\\nhigher illumination.  In fact, Chuang Tzŭ may be said to have summed up\\nin himself almost every mood of European metaphysical or mystical\\nthought, from Heraclitus down to Hegel.  There was something in him of\\nthe Quietist also; and in his worship of Nothing he may be said to have\\nin some measure anticipated those strange dreamers of mediæval days who,\\nlike Tauler and Master Eckhart, adored the _purum nihil_ and the Abyss.\\nThe great middle classes of this country, to whom, as we all know, our\\nprosperity, if not our civilization, is entirely due, may shrug their\\nshoulders over all this and ask, with a certain amount of reason, what is\\nthe identity of contraries to them, and why they should get rid of that\\nself-consciousness which is their chief characteristic.  But Chuang Tzŭ\\nwas something more than a metaphysician and an illuminist.  He sought to\\ndestroy society, as we know it, as the middle classes know it; and the\\nsad thing is that he combines with the passionate eloquence of a Rousseau\\nthe scientific reasoning of a Herbert Spencer.  There is nothing of the\\nsentimentalist in him.  He pities the rich more than the poor, if he even\\npities at all, and prosperity seems to him as tragic a thing as\\nsuffering.  He has nothing of the modern sympathy with failures, nor does\\nhe propose that the prizes should always be given on moral grounds to\\nthose who come in last in the race.  It is the race itself that he\\nobjects to; and as for active sympathy, which has become the profession\\nof so many worthy people in our own day, he thinks that trying to make\\nothers good is as silly an occupation as ‘beating a drum in a forest in\\norder to find a fugitive.’  It is a mere waste of energy.  That is all.\\nWhile, as for a thoroughly sympathetic man, he is, in the eyes of Chuang\\nTzŭ, simply a man who is always trying to be somebody else, and so misses\\nthe only possible excuse for his own existence.\\n\\nYes; incredible as it may seem, this curious thinker looked back with a\\nsigh of regret to a certain Golden Age when there were no competitive\\nexaminations, no wearisome educational systems, no missionaries, no penny\\ndinners for the people, no Established Churches, no Humanitarian\\nSocieties, no dull lectures about one’s duty to one’s neighbour, and no\\ntedious sermons about any subject at all.  In those ideal days, he tells\\nus, people loved each other without being conscious of charity, or\\nwriting to the newspapers about it.  They were upright, and yet they\\nnever published books upon Altruism.  As every man kept his knowledge to\\nhimself, the world escaped the curse of scepticism; and as every man kept\\nhis virtues to himself, nobody meddled in other people’s business.  They\\nlived simple and peaceful lives, and were contented with such food and\\nraiment as they could get.  Neighbouring districts were in sight, and\\n‘the cocks and dogs of one could be heard in the other,’ yet the people\\ngrew old and died without ever interchanging visits.  There was no\\nchattering about clever men, and no laudation of good men.  The\\nintolerable sense of obligation was unknown.  The deeds of humanity left\\nno trace, and their affairs were not made a burden for prosperity by\\nfoolish historians.\\n\\nIn an evil moment the Philanthropist made his appearance, and brought\\nwith him the mischievous idea of Government.  ‘There is such a thing,’\\nsays Chuang Tzŭ, ‘as leaving mankind alone: there has never been such a\\nthing as governing mankind.’  All modes of government are wrong.  They\\nare unscientific, because they seek to alter the natural environment of\\nman; they are immoral because, by interfering with the individual, they\\nproduce the most aggressive forms of egotism; they are ignorant, because\\nthey try to spread education; they are self-destructive, because they\\nengender anarchy.  ‘Of old,’ he tells us, ‘the Yellow Emperor first\\ncaused charity and duty to one’s neighbour to interfere with the natural\\ngoodness of the heart of man.  In consequence of this, Yao and Shun wore\\nthe hair off their legs in endeavouring to feed their people.  They\\ndisturbed their internal economy in order to find room for artificial\\nvirtues.  They exhausted their energies in framing laws, and they were\\nfailures.’  Man’s heart, our philosopher goes on to say, may be ‘forced\\ndown or stirred up,’ and in either case the issue is fatal.  Yao made the\\npeople too happy, so they were not satisfied.  Chieh made them too\\nwretched, so they grew discontented.  Then every one began to argue about\\nthe best way of tinkering up society.  ‘It is quite clear that something\\nmust be done,’ they said to each other, and there was a general rush for\\nknowledge.  The results were so dreadful that the Government of the day\\nhad to bring in Coercion, and as a consequence of this ‘virtuous men\\nsought refuge in mountain caves, while rulers of state sat trembling in\\nancestral halls.’  Then, when everything was in a state of perfect chaos,\\nthe Social Reformers got up on platforms, and preached salvation from the\\nills that they and their system had caused.  The poor Social Reformers!\\n‘They know not shame, nor what it is to blush,’ is the verdict of Chuang\\nTzŭ upon them.\\n\\nThe economic question, also, is discussed by this almond-eyed sage at\\ngreat length, and he writes about the curse of capital as eloquently as\\nMr. Hyndman.  The accumulation of wealth is to him the origin of evil.\\nIt makes the strong violent, and the weak dishonest.  It creates the\\npetty thief, and puts him in a bamboo cage.  It creates the big thief,\\nand sets him on a throne of white jade.  It is the father of competition,\\nand competition is the waste, as well as the destruction, of energy.  The\\norder of nature is rest, repetition, and peace.  Weariness and war are\\nthe results of an artificial society based upon capital; and the richer\\nthis society gets, the more thoroughly bankrupt it really is, for it has\\nneither sufficient rewards for the good nor sufficient punishments for\\nthe wicked.  There is also this to be remembered—that the prizes of the\\nworld degrade a man as much as the world’s punishments.  The age is\\nrotten with its worship of success.  As for education, true wisdom can\\nneither be learnt nor taught.  It is a spiritual state, to which he who\\nlives in harmony with nature attains.  Knowledge is shallow if we compare\\nit with the extent of the unknown, and only the unknowable is of value.\\nSociety produces rogues, and education makes one rogue cleverer than\\nanother.  That is the only result of School Boards.  Besides, of what\\npossible philosophic importance can education be, when it serves simply\\nto make each man differ from his neighbour?  We arrive ultimately at a\\nchaos of opinions, doubt everything, and fall into the vulgar habit of\\narguing; and it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Look at\\nHui Tzu.  ‘He was a man of many ideas.  His work would fill five carts.\\nBut his doctrines were paradoxical.’  He said that there were feathers in\\nan egg, because there were feathers on a chicken; that a dog could be a\\nsheep, because all names were arbitrary; that there was a moment when a\\nswift-flying arrow was neither moving nor at rest; that if you took a\\nstick a foot long, and cut it in half every day, you would never come to\\nthe end of it; and that a bay horse and a dun cow were three, because\\ntaken separately they were two, and taken together they were one, and one\\nand two made up three.  ‘He was like a man running a race with his own\\nshadow, and making a noise in order to drown the echo.  He was a clever\\ngadfly, that was all.  What was the use of him?’\\n\\nMorality is, of course, a different thing.  It went out of fashion, says\\nChuang Tzŭ, when people began to moralize.  Men ceased then to be\\nspontaneous and to act on intuition.  They became priggish and\\nartificial, and were so blind as to have a definite purpose in life.\\nThen came Governments and Philanthropists, those two pests of the age.\\nThe former tried to coerce people into being good, and so destroyed the\\nnatural goodness of man.  The latter were a set of aggressive busybodies\\nwho caused confusion wherever they went.  They were stupid enough to have\\nprinciples, and unfortunate enough to act up to them.  They all came to\\nbad ends, and showed that universal altruism is as bad in its results as\\nuniversal egotism.  ‘They tripped people up over charity, and fettered\\nthem with duties to their neighbours.’  They gushed over music, and\\nfussed over ceremonies.  As a consequence of all this, the world lost its\\nequilibrium, and has been staggering ever since.\\n\\nWho, then, according to Chuang Tzŭ, is the perfect man?  And what is his\\nmanner of life?  The perfect man does nothing beyond gazing at the\\nuniverse.  He adopts no absolute position.  ‘In motion, he is like water.\\nAt rest, he is like a mirror.  And, like Echo, he answers only when he is\\ncalled upon.’  He lets externals take care of themselves.  Nothing\\nmaterial injures him; nothing spiritual punishes him.  His mental\\nequilibrium gives him the empire of the world.  He is never the slave of\\nobjective existences.  He knows that, ‘just as the best language is that\\nwhich is never spoken, so the best action is that which is never done.’\\nHe is passive, and accepts the laws of life.  He rests in inactivity, and\\nsees the world become virtuous of itself.  He does not try to ‘bring\\nabout his own good deeds.’  He never wastes himself on effort.  He is not\\ntroubled about moral distinctions.  He knows that things are what they\\nare, and that their consequences will be what they will be.  His mind is\\nthe ‘speculum of creation,’ and he is ever at peace.\\n\\nAll this is of course excessively dangerous, but we must remember that\\nChuang Tzŭ lived more than two thousand years ago, and never had the\\nopportunity of seeing our unrivalled civilization.  And yet it is\\npossible that, were he to come back to earth and visit us, he might have\\nsomething to say to Mr. Balfour about his coercion and active\\nmisgovernment in Ireland; he might smile at some of our philanthropic\\nardours, and shake his head over many of our organized charities; the\\nSchool Board might not impress him, nor our race for wealth stir his\\nadmiration; he might wonder at our ideals, and grow sad over what we have\\nrealized.  Perhaps it is well that Chuang Tzŭ cannot return.\\n\\nMeanwhile, thanks to Mr. Giles and Mr. Quaritch, we have his book to\\nconsole us, and certainly it is a most fascinating and delightful volume.\\nChuang Tzŭ is one of the Darwinians before Darwin.  He traces man from\\nthe germ, and sees his unity with nature.  As an anthropologist he is\\nexcessively interesting, and he describes our primitive arboreal ancestor\\nliving in trees through his terror of animals stronger than himself, and\\nknowing only one parent, the mother, with all the accuracy of a lecturer\\nat the Royal Society.  Like Plato, he adopts the dialogue as his mode of\\nexpression, ‘putting words into other people’s mouths,’ he tells us, ‘in\\norder to gain breadth of view.’  As a story-teller he is charming.  The\\naccount of the visit of the respectable Confucius to the great Robber Chê\\nis most vivid and brilliant, and it is impossible not to laugh over the\\nultimate discomfiture of the sage, the barrenness of whose moral\\nplatitudes is ruthlessly exposed by the successful brigand.  Even in his\\nmetaphysics, Chuang Tzŭ is intensely humorous.  He personifies his\\nabstractions, and makes them act plays before us.  The Spirit of the\\nClouds, when passing eastward through the expanse of air, happened to\\nfall in with the Vital Principle.  The latter was slapping his ribs and\\nhopping about: whereupon the Spirit of the Clouds said, ‘Who are you, old\\nman, and what are you doing?’  ‘Strolling!’ replied the Vital Principle,\\nwithout stopping, for all activities are ceaseless.  ‘I want to _know_\\nsomething,’ continued the Spirit of the Clouds.  ‘Ah!’ cried the Vital\\nPrinciple, in a tone of disapprobation, and a marvellous conversation\\nfollows, that is not unlike the dialogue between the Sphinx and the\\nChimera in Flaubert’s curious drama.  Talking animals, also, have their\\nplace in Chuang Tzŭ’s parables and stories, and through myth and poetry\\nand fancy his strange philosophy finds musical utterance.\\n\\nOf course it is sad to be told that it is immoral to be consciously good,\\nand that doing anything is the worst form of idleness.  Thousands of\\nexcellent and really earnest philanthropists would be absolutely thrown\\nupon the rates if we adopted the view that nobody should be allowed to\\nmeddle in what does not concern him.  The doctrine of the uselessness of\\nall useful things would not merely endanger our commercial supremacy as a\\nnation, but might bring discredit upon many prosperous and serious-minded\\nmembers of the shop-keeping classes.  What would become of our popular\\npreachers, our Exeter Hall orators, our drawing-room evangelists, if we\\nsaid to them, in the words of Chuang Tzŭ, ‘Mosquitoes will keep a man\\nawake all night with their biting, and just in the same way this talk of\\ncharity and duty to one’s neighbour drives us nearly crazy.  Sirs, strive\\nto keep the world to its own original simplicity, and, as the wind\\nbloweth where it listeth, so let Virtue establish itself.  Wherefore this\\nundue energy?’  And what would be the fate of governments and\\nprofessional politicians if we came to the conclusion that there is no\\nsuch thing as governing mankind at all?  It is clear that Chuang Tzŭ is a\\nvery dangerous writer, and the publication of his book in English, two\\nthousand years after his death, is obviously premature, and may cause a\\ngreat deal of pain to many thoroughly respectable and industrious\\npersons.  It may be true that the ideal of self-culture and\\nself-development, which is the aim of his scheme of life, and the basis\\nof his scheme of philosophy, is an ideal somewhat needed by an age like\\nours, in which most people are so anxious to educate their neighbours\\nthat they have actually no time left in which to educate themselves.  But\\nwould it be wise to say so?  It seems to me that if we once admitted the\\nforce of any one of Chuang Tzŭ’s destructive criticisms we should have to\\nput some check on our national habit of self-glorification; and the only\\nthing that ever consoles man for the stupid things he does is the praise\\nhe always gives himself for doing them.  There may, however, be a few who\\nhave grown wearied of that strange modern tendency that sets enthusiasm\\nto do the work of the intellect.  To these, and such as these, Chuang Tzŭ\\nwill be welcome.  But let them only read him.  Let them not talk about\\nhim.  He would be disturbing at dinner-parties, and impossible at\\nafternoon teas, and his whole life was a protest against platform\\nspeaking.  ‘The perfect man ignores self; the divine man ignores action;\\nthe true sage ignores reputation.’  These are the principles of Chuang\\nTzŭ.\\n\\n_Chuang Tzŭ_: _Mystic_, _Moralist_, _and Social Reformer_.  Translated\\nfrom the Chinese by Herbert A. Giles, H.B.M.’s Consul at Tamsui.\\n(Bernard Quaritch.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMR. PATER’S _APPRECIATIONS_\\n(_Speaker_, March 22, 1890.)\\n\\n\\nWhen I first had the privilege—and I count it a very high one—of meeting\\nMr. Walter Pater, he said to me, smiling, ‘Why do you always write\\npoetry?  Why do you not write prose?  Prose is so much more difficult.’\\n\\nIt was during my undergraduate days at Oxford; days of lyrical ardour and\\nof studious sonnet-writing; days when one loved the exquisite intricacy\\nand musical repetitions of the ballade, and the villanelle with its\\nlinked long-drawn echoes and its curious completeness; days when one\\nsolemnly sought to discover the proper temper in which a triolet should\\nbe written; delightful days, in which, I am glad to say, there was far\\nmore rhyme than reason.\\n\\nI may frankly confess now that at the time I did not quite comprehend\\nwhat Mr. Pater really meant; and it was not till I had carefully studied\\nhis beautiful and suggestive essays on the Renaissance that I fully\\nrealized what a wonderful self-conscious art the art of English\\nprose-writing really is, or may be made to be.  Carlyle’s stormy\\nrhetoric, Ruskin’s winged and passionate eloquence, had seemed to me to\\nspring from enthusiasm rather than from art.  I do not think I knew then\\nthat even prophets correct their proofs.  As for Jacobean prose, I\\nthought it too exuberant; and Queen Anne prose appeared to me terribly\\nbald, and irritatingly rational.  But Mr. Pater’s essays became to me\\n‘the golden book of spirit and sense, the holy writ of beauty.’  They are\\nstill this to me.  It is possible, of course, that I may exaggerate about\\nthem.  I certainly hope that I do; for where there is no exaggeration\\nthere is no love, and where there is no love there is no understanding.\\nIt is only about things that do not interest one, that one can give a\\nreally unbiassed opinion; and this is no doubt the reason why an\\nunbiassed opinion is always valueless.\\n\\nBut I must not allow this brief notice of Mr. Pater’s new volume to\\ndegenerate into an autobiography.  I remember being told in America that\\nwhenever Margaret Fuller wrote an essay upon Emerson the printers had\\nalways to send out to borrow some additional capital ‘I’s,’ and I feel it\\nright to accept this transatlantic warning.\\n\\n_Appreciations_, in the fine Latin sense of the word, is the title given\\nby Mr. Pater to his book, which is an exquisite collection of exquisite\\nessays, of delicately wrought works of art—some of them being almost\\nGreek in their purity of outline and perfection of form, others mediæval\\nin their strangeness of colour and passionate suggestion, and all of them\\nabsolutely modern, in the true meaning of the term modernity.  For he to\\nwhom the present is the only thing that is present, knows nothing of the\\nage in which he lives.  To realize the nineteenth century one must\\nrealize every century that has preceded it, and that has contributed to\\nits making.  To know anything about oneself, one must know all about\\nothers.  There must be no mood with which one cannot sympathize, no dead\\nmode of life that one cannot make alive.  The legacies of heredity may\\nmake us alter our views of moral responsibility, but they cannot but\\nintensify our sense of the value of Criticism; for the true critic is he\\nwho bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriad\\ngenerations, and to whom no form of thought is alien, no emotional\\nimpulse obscure.\\n\\nPerhaps the most interesting, and certainly the least successful, of the\\nessays contained in the present volume is that on _Style_.  It is the\\nmost interesting because it is the work of one who speaks with the high\\nauthority that comes from the noble realization of things nobly\\nconceived.  It is the least successful, because the subject is too\\nabstract.  A true artist like Mr. Pater is most felicitous when he deals\\nwith the concrete, whose very limitations give him finer freedom, while\\nthey necessitate more intense vision.  And yet what a high ideal is\\ncontained in these few pages!  How good it is for us, in these days of\\npopular education and facile journalism, to be reminded of the real\\nscholarship that is essential to the perfect writer, who, ‘being a true\\nlover of words for their own sake, a minute and constant observer of\\ntheir physiognomy,’ will avoid what is mere rhetoric, or ostentatious\\nornament, or negligent misuse of terms, or ineffective surplusage, and\\nwill be known by his tact of omission, by his skilful economy of means,\\nby his selection and self-restraint, and perhaps above all by that\\nconscious artistic structure which is the expression of mind in style.  I\\nthink I have been wrong in saying that the subject is too abstract.  In\\nMr. Pater’s hands it becomes very real to us indeed, and he shows us how,\\nbehind the perfection of a man’s style, must lie the passion of a man’s\\nsoul.\\n\\nAs one passes to the rest of the volume, one finds essays on Wordsworth\\nand on Coleridge, on Charles Lamb and on Sir Thomas Browne, on some of\\nShakespeare’s plays and on the English kings that Shakespeare fashioned,\\non Dante Rossetti, and on William Morris.  As that on Wordsworth seems to\\nbe Mr. Pater’s last work, so that on the singer of the _Defence of\\nGuenevere_ is certainly his earliest, or almost his earliest, and it is\\ninteresting to mark the change that has taken place in his style.  This\\nchange is, perhaps, at first sight not very apparent.  In 1868 we find\\nMr. Pater writing with the same exquisite care for words, with the same\\nstudied music, with the same temper, and something of the same mode of\\ntreatment.  But, as he goes on, the architecture of the style becomes\\nricher and more complex, the epithet more precise and intellectual.\\nOccasionally one may be inclined to think that there is, here and there,\\na sentence which is somewhat long, and possibly, if one may venture to\\nsay so, a little heavy and cumbersome in movement.  But if this be so, it\\ncomes from those side-issues suddenly suggested by the idea in its\\nprogress, and really revealing the idea more perfectly; or from those\\nfelicitous after-thoughts that give a fuller completeness to the central\\nscheme, and yet convey something of the charm of chance; or from a desire\\nto suggest the secondary shades of meaning with all their accumulating\\neffect, and to avoid, it may be, the violence and harshness of too\\ndefinite and exclusive an opinion.  For in matters of art, at any rate,\\nthought is inevitably coloured by emotion, and so is fluid rather than\\nfixed, and, recognizing its dependence upon the moods and upon the\\npassion of fine moments, will not accept the rigidity of a scientific\\nformula or a theological dogma.  The critical pleasure, too, that we\\nreceive from tracing, through what may seem the intricacies of a\\nsentence, the working of the constructive intelligence, must not be\\noverlooked.  As soon as we have realized the design, everything appears\\nclear and simple.  After a time, these long sentences of Mr. Pater’s come\\nto have the charm of an elaborate piece of music, and the unity of such\\nmusic also.\\n\\nI have suggested that the essay on Wordsworth is probably the most recent\\nbit of work contained in this volume.  If one might choose between so\\nmuch that is good, I should be inclined to say it is the finest also.\\nThe essay on Lamb is curiously suggestive; suggestive, indeed, of a\\nsomewhat more tragic, more sombre figure, than men have been wont to\\nthink of in connection with the author of the _Essays of Elia_.  It is an\\ninteresting aspect under which to regard Lamb, but perhaps he himself\\nwould have had some difficulty in recognizing the portrait given of him.\\nHe had, undoubtedly, great sorrows, or motives for sorrow, but he could\\nconsole himself at a moment’s notice for the real tragedies of life by\\nreading any one of the Elizabethan tragedies, provided it was in a folio\\nedition.  The essay on Sir Thomas Browne is delightful, and has the\\nstrange, personal, fanciful charm of the author of the _Religio Medici_,\\nMr. Pater often catching the colour and accent and tone of whatever\\nartist, or work of art, he deals with.  That on Coleridge, with its\\ninsistence on the necessity of the cultivation of the relative, as\\nopposed to the absolute spirit in philosophy and in ethics, and its high\\nappreciation of the poet’s true position in our literature, is in style\\nand substance a very blameless work.  Grace of expression and delicate\\nsubtlety of thought and phrase, characterize the essays on Shakespeare.\\nBut the essay on Wordsworth has a spiritual beauty of its own.  It\\nappeals, not to the ordinary Wordsworthian with his uncritical temper,\\nand his gross confusion of ethical and æsthetical problems, but rather to\\nthose who desire to separate the gold from the dross, and to reach at the\\ntrue Wordsworth through the mass of tedious and prosaic work that bears\\nhis name, and that serves often to conceal him from us.  The presence of\\nan alien element in Wordsworth’s art is, of course, recognized by Mr.\\nPater, but he touches on it merely from the psychological point of view,\\npointing out how this quality of higher and lower moods gives the effect\\nin his poetry ‘of a power not altogether his own, or under his control’;\\na power which comes and goes when it wills, ‘so that the old fancy which\\nmade the poet’s art an enthusiasm, a form of divine possession, seems\\nalmost true of him.’  Mr. Pater’s earlier essays had their _purpurei\\npanni_, so eminently suitable for quotation, such as the famous passage\\non _Mona Lisa_, and that other in which Botticelli’s strange conception\\nof the Virgin is so strangely set forth.  From the present volume it is\\ndifficult to select any one passage in preference to another as specially\\ncharacteristic of Mr. Pater’s treatment.  This, however, is worth quoting\\nat length.  It contains a truth eminently suitable for our age:\\n\\n    That the end of life is not action but contemplation—_being_ as\\n    distinct from _doing_—a certain disposition of the mind: is, in some\\n    shape or other, the principle of all the higher morality.  In poetry,\\n    in art, if you enter into their true spirit at all, you touch this\\n    principle in a measure; these, by their sterility, are a type of\\n    beholding for the mere joy of beholding.  To treat life in the spirit\\n    of art is to make life a thing in which means and ends are\\n    identified: to encourage such treatment, the true moral significance\\n    of art and poetry.  Wordsworth, and other poets who have been like\\n    him in ancient or more recent times, are the masters, the experts, in\\n    this art of impassioned contemplation.  Their work is not to teach\\n    lessons, or enforce rules, or even to stimulate us to noble ends, but\\n    to withdraw the thoughts for a while from the mere machinery of life,\\n    to fix them, with appropriate emotions, on the spectacle of those\\n    great facts in man’s existence which no machinery affects, ‘on the\\n    great and universal passions of men, the most general and interesting\\n    of their occupations, and the entire world of nature’—on ‘the\\n    operations of the elements and the appearances of the visible\\n    universe, on storm and sunshine, on the revolutions of the seasons,\\n    on cold and heat, on loss of friends and kindred, on injuries and\\n    resentments, on gratitude and hope, on fear and sorrow.’  To witness\\n    this spectacle with appropriate emotions is the aim of all culture;\\n    and of these emotions poetry like Wordsworth’s is a great nourisher\\n    and stimulant.  He sees nature full of sentiment and excitement; he\\n    sees men and women as parts of nature, passionate, excited, in\\n    strange grouping and connection with the grandeur and beauty of the\\n    natural world:—images, in his own words, ‘of men suffering; amid\\n    awful forms and powers.’\\n\\nCertainly the real secret of Wordsworth has never been better expressed.\\nAfter having read and reread Mr. Pater’s essay—for it requires\\nre-reading—one returns to the poet’s work with a new sense of joy and\\nwonder, and with something of eager and impassioned expectation.  And\\nperhaps this might be roughly taken as the test or touchstone of the\\nfinest criticism.\\n\\nFinally, one cannot help noticing the delicate instinct that has gone to\\nfashion the brief epilogue that ends this delightful volume.  The\\ndifference between the classical and romantic spirits in art has often,\\nand with much over-emphasis, been discussed.  But with what a light sure\\ntouch does Mr. Pater write of it!  How subtle and certain are his\\ndistinctions!  If imaginative prose be really the special art of this\\ncentury, Mr. Pater must rank amongst our century’s most characteristic\\nartists.  In certain things he stands almost alone.  The age has produced\\nwonderful prose styles, turbid with individualism, and violent with\\nexcess of rhetoric.  But in Mr. Pater, as in Cardinal Newman, we find the\\nunion of personality with perfection.  He has no rival in his own sphere,\\nand he has escaped disciples.  And this, not because he has not been\\nimitated, but because in art so fine as his there is something that, in\\nits essence, is inimitable.\\n\\n_Appreciations_, _with an Essay on Style_.  By Walter Pater, Fellow of\\nBrasenose College.  (Macmillan and Co.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSENTENTIAE\\n(_Extracted from Reviews_)\\n\\n\\nPerhaps he will write poetry some day.

The\\noriginality, I mean, which we ask from the artist, is originality of\\ntreatment, not of subject.  It is only the unimaginative who ever\\ninvents.  The true artist is known by the use he makes of what he\\nannexes, and he annexes everything.\\n\\nIf I ventured on a bit of advice, which I feel most reluctant to do, it\\nwould be to the effect that while one should always study the method of a\\ngreat artist, one should never imitate his manner.  The manner of an\\nartist is essentially individual, the method of an artist is absolutely\\nuniversal.  The first is personality, which no one should copy; the\\nsecond is perfection, which all should aim at.\\n\\nA critic who posed as an authority on field sports assured me that no one\\never went out hunting when roses were in full bloom.

To a land out of breath in its greed for gain he\\nshowed the example of a life devoted entirely to the study of literature;\\nhis lectures, though not by any means brilliant, were still productive of\\nmuch good; he had a most charming and gracious personality, and he wrote\\nsome pretty poems.

He never trafficked with the merchants\\nfor his soul, nor brought his wares into the market-place for the idle to\\ngape at.  Passionate and romantic though he was, yet there was in his\\nnature something of high austerity.  He loved seclusion, and hated\\nnotoriety, and would have shuddered at the idea that within a few years\\nafter his death he was to make his appearance in a series of popular\\nbiographies, sandwiched between the author of _Pickwick_ and the Great\\nLexicographer.\\n\\nWe sincerely hope that a few more novels like these will be published, as\\nthe public will then find out that a bad book is very dear at a shilling.\\n\\nThe only form of fiction in which real characters do not seem out of\\nplace is history.

Part of Keats’s charm as a man is his fascinating\\nincompleteness.\\n\\nThe Apostolic dictum, that women should not be suffered to teach, is no\\nlonger applicable to a society such as ours, with its solidarity of\\ninterests, its recognition of natural rights, and its universal\\neducation, however suitable it may have been to the Greek cities under\\nRoman rule.  Nothing in the United States struck me more than the fact\\nthat the remarkable intellectual progress of that country is very largely\\ndue to the efforts of American women, who edit many of the most powerful\\nmagazines and newspapers, take part in the discussion of every question\\nof public interest, and exercise an important influence upon the growth\\nand tendencies of literature and art.  Indeed, the women of America are\\nthe one class in the community that enjoys that leisure which is so\\nnecessary for culture.  The men are, as a rule, so absorbed in business,\\nthat the task of bringing some element of form into the chaos of daily\\nlife is left almost entirely to the opposite sex, and an eminent\\nBostonian once assured me that in the twentieth century the whole culture\\nof his country would be in petticoats.  By that time, however, it is\\nprobable that the dress of the two sexes will be assimilated, as\\nsimilarity of costume always follows similarity of pursuits.\\n\\nThe aim of social comedy, in Menander no less than in Sheridan, is to\\nmirror the manners, not to reform the morals, of its day, and the censure\\nof the Puritan, whether real or affected, is always out of place in\\nliterary criticism, and shows a want of recognition of the essential\\ndistinction between art and life.  After all, it is only the Philistine\\nwho thinks of blaming Jack Absolute for his deception, Bob Acres for his\\ncowardice, and Charles Surface for his extravagance, and there is very\\nlittle use in airing one’s moral sense at the expense of one’s artistic\\nappreciation.\\n\\nThe _Æneid_ bears almost the same relation to the _Iliad_ that the\\n_Idylls of the King_ do to the old Celtic romances of Arthur.  Like them\\nit is full of felicitous modernisms, of exquisite literary echoes and of\\ndelicate and delightful pictures; as Lord Tennyson loves England so did\\nVirgil love Rome; the pageants of history and the purple of empire are\\nequally dear to both poets; but neither of them has the grand simplicity\\nor the large humanity of the early singers, and, as a hero, Æneas is no\\nless a failure than Arthur.\\n\\nThere is always a certain amount of danger in any attempt to cultivate\\nimpossible virtues.\\n\\nAs far as the serious presentation of life is concerned, what we require\\nis more imaginative treatment, greater freedom from theatric language and\\ntheatric convention.  It may be questioned, also, whether the consistent\\nreward of virtue and punishment of wickedness be really the healthiest\\nideal for an art that claims to mirror nature.\\n\\nTrue originality is to be found rather in the use made of a model than in\\nthe rejection of all models and masters.  _Dans l’art comme dans la\\nnature on est toujours fils de quelqu’un_, and we should not quarrel with\\nthe reed if it whispers to us the music of the lyre.  A little child once\\nasked me if it was the nightingale who taught the linnets how to sing.\\n\\nIn France they have had one great genius, Balzac, who invented the modern\\nmethod of looking at life; and one great artist, Flaubert, who is the\\nimpeccable master of style; and to the influence of these two men we may\\ntrace almost all contemporary French fiction.  But in England we have had\\nno schools worth speaking of.  The fiery torch lit by the Brontës has not\\nbeen passed on to other hands; Dickens has influenced only journalism;\\nThackeray’s delightful superficial philosophy, superb narrative power,\\nand clever social satire have found no echoes; nor has Trollope left any\\ndirect successors behind him—a fact which is not much to be regretted,\\nhowever, as, admirable though Trollope undoubtedly is for rainy\\nafternoons and tedious railway journeys, from the point of view of\\nliterature he is merely the perpetual curate of Pudlington Parva.\\n\\nGeorge Meredith’s style is chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of\\nlightning.  As a writer he has mastered everything, except language; as a\\nnovelist he can do everything, except tell a story; as an artist he is\\neverything, except articulate.  Too strange to be popular, too individual\\nto have imitators, the author of _Richard Feverel_ stands absolutely\\nalone.  It is easy to disarm criticism, but he has disarmed the disciple.\\nHe gives us his philosophy through the medium of wit, and is never so\\npathetic as when he is humorous.  To turn truth into a paradox is not\\ndifficult, but George Meredith makes all his paradoxes truths, and no\\nTheseus can thread his labyrinth, no Œdipus solve his secret.\\n\\nThe most perfect and the most poisonous of all modern French poets once\\nremarked that a man can live for three days without bread, but that no\\none can live for three days without poetry.  This, however, can hardly be\\nsaid to be a popular view, or one that commends itself to that curiously\\nuncommon quality which is called common-sense.  I fancy that most people,\\nif they do not actually prefer a salmis to a sonnet, certainly like their\\nculture to repose on a basis of good cookery.\\n\\nA cynical critic once remarked that no great poet is intelligible and no\\nlittle poet worth understanding, but that otherwise poetry is an\\nadmirable thing.  This, however, seems to us a somewhat harsh view of the\\nsubject.  Little poets are an extremely interesting study.  The best of\\nthem have often some new beauty to show us, and though the worst of them\\nmay bore yet they rarely brutalize.\\n\\nIt is a curious thing that when minor poets write choruses to a play they\\nshould always consider it necessary to adopt the style and language of a\\nbad translator.  We fear that Mr. Bohn has much to answer for.\\n\\nIn one sonnet he makes a distinct attempt to be original and the result\\nis extremely depressing.\\n\\n    Earth wears her grandest robe, by autumn spun,\\n    _Like some stout matron who of youth has run_\\n    _The course_, . . .\\n\\nis the most dreadful simile we have ever come across even in poetry.  Mr.\\nGriffiths should beware of originality.  Like beauty, it is a fatal gift.\\n\\nThere is a wide difference between the beautiful Tuscan city and the\\nsea-city of the Adriatic.  Florence is a city full of memories of the\\ngreat figures of the past.  The traveller cannot pass along her streets\\nwithout treading in the very traces of Dante, without stepping on soil\\nmade memorable by footprints never to be effaced.  The greatness of the\\nsurroundings, the palaces, churches, and frowning mediæval castles in the\\nmidst of the city, are all thrown into the background by the greatness,\\nthe individuality, the living power and vigour of the men who are their\\noriginators, and at the same time their inspiring soul.  But when we turn\\nto Venice the effect is very different.  We do not think of the makers of\\nthat marvellous city, but rather of what they made.  The idealized image\\nof Venice herself meets us everywhere.  The mother is not overshadowed by\\nthe too great glory of any of her sons.  In her records the city is\\neverything—the republic, the worshipped ideal of a community in which\\nevery man for the common glory seems to have been willing to sink his\\nown.  We know that Dante stood within the red walls of the arsenal, and\\nsaw the galleys making and mending, and the pitch flaming up to heaven;\\nPetrarch came to visit the great Mistress of the Sea, taking refuge\\nthere, ‘in this city, true home of the human race,’ from trouble, war and\\npestilence outside; and Byron, with his facile enthusiasms and fervent\\neloquence, made his home for a time in one of the stately, decaying\\npalaces; but with these exceptions no great poet has ever associated\\nhimself with the life of Venice.  She had architects, sculptors and\\npainters, but no singer of her own.\\n\\nTo realize the popularity of the great poets one should turn to the minor\\npoets and see whom they follow, what master they select, whose music they\\necho.\\n\\nOrdinary theology has long since converted its gold into lead, and words\\nand phrases that once touched the heart of the world have become\\nwearisome and meaningless through repetition.  If Theology desires to\\nmove us, she must re-write her formulas.\\n\\nIt takes a great artist to be thoroughly modern.  Nature is always a\\nlittle behind the age.\\n\\nMr. Nash, who styles himself ‘a humble soldier in the army of Faith,’\\nexpresses a hope that his book may ‘invigorate devotional feeling,\\nespecially among the young, to whom verse is perhaps more attractive than\\nto their elders,’ but we should be sorry to think that people of any age\\ncould admire such a paraphrase as the following:\\n\\n    Foxes have holes in which to slink for rest,\\n    The birds of air find shelter in the nest;\\n    But He, the Son of Man and Lord of all,\\n    Has no abiding place His own to call.\\n\\nIt is a curious fact that the worst work is always done with the best\\nintentions, and that people are never so trivial as when they take\\nthemselves very seriously.\\n\\nMr. Foster is an American poet who has read Hawthorne, which is wise of\\nhim, and imitated Longfellow, which is not quite so commendable.\\n\\n_Andiatoroctè_ is the title of a volume of poems by the Rev. Clarence\\nWalworth, of Albany, N.Y.  It is a word borrowed from the Indians, and\\nshould, we think, be returned to them as soon as possible.  The most\\ncurious poem of the book is called _Scenes at the Holy Home_:\\n\\n       Jesus and Joseph at work!  Hurra!\\n    Sight never to see again,\\n       A prentice Deity plies the saw,\\n    While the Master ploughs with the plane.\\n\\nPoems of this kind were popular in the Middle Ages when the cathedrals of\\nevery Christian country served as its theatres.  They are anachronisms\\nnow, and it is odd that they should come to us from the United States.\\nIn matters of this kind we should have some protection.\\n\\nAs for the triolets, and the rondels, and the careful study of metrical\\nsubtleties, these things are merely the signs of a desire for perfection\\nin small things and of the recognition of poetry as an art.  They have\\nhad certainly one good result—they have made our minor poets readable,\\nand have not left us entirely at the mercy of geniuses.\\n\\nPoetry has many modes of music; she does not blow through one pipe alone.\\nDirectness of utterance is good, but so is the subtle recasting of\\nthought into a new and delightful form.  Simplicity is good, but\\ncomplexity, mystery, strangeness, symbolism, obscurity even, these have\\ntheir value.  Indeed, properly speaking, there is no such thing as Style;\\nthere are merely styles, that is all.\\n\\nWriters of poetical prose are rarely good poets.\\n\\nPoetry may be said to need far more self-restraint than prose.  Its\\nconditions are more exquisite.  It produces its effects by more subtle\\nmeans.  It must not be allowed to degenerate into mere rhetoric or mere\\neloquence.  It is, in one sense, the most self-conscious of all the arts,\\nas it is never a means to an end but always an end in itself.\\n\\nIt may be difficult for a poet to find English synonyms for Asiatic\\nexpressions, but even if it were impossible it is none the less a poet’s\\nduty to find them.  As it is, Sir Edwin Arnold has translated Sa’di and\\nsome one must translate Sir Edwin Arnold.\\n\\nLounging in the open air is not a bad school for poets, but it largely\\ndepends on the lounger.\\n\\nPeople are so fond of giving away what they do not want themselves, that\\ncharity is largely on the increase.  But with this kind of charity I have\\nnot much sympathy.  If one gives away a book, it should be a charming\\nbook—so charming, that one regrets having given it.\\n\\nMr. Whistler, for some reason or other, always adopted the phraseology of\\nthe minor prophets.  Possibly it was in order to emphasize his well-known\\nclaims to verbal inspiration, or perhaps he thought with Voltaire that\\n_Habakkuk était capable de tout_, and wished to shelter himself under the\\nshield of a definitely irresponsible writer none of whose prophecies,\\naccording to the French philosopher, has ever been fulfilled.  The idea\\nwas clever enough at the beginning, but ultimately the manner became\\nmonotonous.  The spirit of the Hebrews is excellent but their mode of\\nwriting is not to be imitated, and no amount of American jokes will give\\nit that modernity which is essential to a good literary style.  Admirable\\nas are Mr. Whistler’s fireworks on canvas, his fireworks in prose are\\nabrupt, violent and exaggerated.\\n\\n‘The decisive events of the world,’ as has been well said, ‘take place in\\nthe intellect,’ and as for Board-schools, academic ceremonies, hospital\\nwards and the like, they may be well left to the artists of the\\nillustrated papers, who do them admirably and quite as well as they need\\nbe done.  Indeed, the pictures of contemporary events, Royal marriages,\\nnaval reviews and things of this kind that appear in the Academy every\\nyear, are always extremely bad; while the very same subjects treated in\\nblack and white in the _Graphic_ or the _London News_ are excellent.\\nBesides, if we want to understand the history of a nation through the\\nmedium of art, it is to the imaginative and ideal arts that we have to go\\nand not to the arts that are definitely imitative.  The visible aspect of\\nlife no longer contains for us the secret of life’s spirit.\\n\\nThe difficulty under which the novelists of our day labour seems to me to\\nbe this: if they do not go into society, their books are unreadable; and\\nif they do go into society, they have no time left for writing.\\n\\nI must confess that most modern mysticism seems to me to be simply a\\nmethod of imparting useless knowledge in a form that no one can\\nunderstand.  Allegory, parable, and vision have their high artistic uses,\\nbut their philosophical and scientific uses are very small.\\n\\nThe object of most modern fiction is not to give pleasure to the artistic\\ninstinct, but rather to portray life vividly for us, to draw attention to\\nsocial anomalies, and social forms of injustice.  Many of our novelists\\nare really pamphleteers, reformers masquerading as story-tellers, earnest\\nsociologists seeking to mend as well as to mirror life.\\n\\nThe book is certainly characteristic of an age so practical and so\\nliterary as ours, an age in which all social reforms have been preceded\\nand have been largely influenced by fiction.\\n\\nMr. Stopford Brooke said some time ago that Socialism and the socialistic\\nspirit would give our poets nobler and loftier themes for song, would\\nwiden their sympathies and enlarge the horizon of their vision, and would\\ntouch, with the fire and fervour of a new faith, lips that had else been\\nsilent, hearts that but for this fresh gospel had been cold.  What Art\\ngains from contemporary events is always a fascinating problem and a\\nproblem that is not easy to solve.  It is, however, certain that\\nSocialism starts well equipped.  She has her poets and her painters, her\\nart lecturers and her cunning designers, her powerful orators and her\\nclever writers.  If she fails it will not be for lack of expression.  If\\nshe succeeds her triumph will not be a triumph of mere brute force.\\n\\nSocialism is not going to allow herself to be trammelled by any hard and\\nfast creed or to be stereotyped into an iron formula.  She welcomes many\\nand multiform natures.  She rejects none and has room for all.  She has\\nthe attraction of a wonderful personality and touches the heart of one\\nand the brain of another, and draws this man by his hatred and injustice,\\nand his neighbour by his faith in the future, and a third, it may be, by\\nhis love of art or by his wild worship of a lost and buried past.  And\\nall of this is well.  For, to make men Socialists is nothing, but to make\\nSocialism human is a great thing.\\n\\nThe Reformation gained much from the use of popular hymn-tunes, and the\\nSocialists seem determined to gain by similar means a similar hold upon\\nthe people.  However, they must not be too sanguine about the result.\\nThe walls of Thebes rose up to the sound of music, and Thebes was a very\\ndull city indeed.\\n\\nWe really must protest against Mr. Matthews’ efforts to confuse the\\npoetry of Piccadilly with the poetry of Parnassus.  To tell us, for\\ninstance, that Mr. Austin Dobson’s verse ‘has not the condensed clearness\\nnor the incisive vigor of Mr. Locker’s’ is really too bad even for\\nTransatlantic criticism.  Nobody who lays claim to the slightest\\nknowledge of literature and the forms of literature should ever bring the\\ntwo names into conjunction.\\n\\nMr. Dobson has produced work that is absolutely classical in its\\nexquisite beauty of form.  Nothing more artistically perfect in its way\\nthan the _Lines to a Greek Girl_ has been written in our time.  This\\nlittle poem will be remembered in literature as long as _Thyrsis_ is\\nremembered, and _Thyrsis_ will never be forgotten.  Both have that note\\nof distinction that is so rare in these days of violence, exaggeration\\nand rhetoric.  Of course, to suggest, as Mr. Matthews does, that Mr.\\nDobson’s poems belong to ‘the literature of power’ is ridiculous.  Power\\nis not their aim, nor is it their effect.  They have other qualities, and\\nin their own delicately limited sphere they have no contemporary rivals;\\nthey have none even second to them.\\n\\nThe heroine is a sort of well-worn Becky Sharp, only much more beautiful\\nthan Becky, or at least than Thackeray’s portraits of her, which,\\nhowever, have always seemed to me rather ill-natured.  I feel sure that\\nMrs. Rawdon Crawley was extremely pretty, and I have never understood how\\nit was that Thackeray could caricature with his pencil so fascinating a\\ncreation of his pen.\\n\\nA critic recently remarked of Adam Lindsay Gordon that through him\\nAustralia had found her first fine utterance in song.  This, however, is\\nan amiable error.  There is very little of Australia in Gordon’s poetry.\\nHis heart and mind and fancy were always preoccupied with memories and\\ndreams of England and such culture as England gave him.  He owed nothing\\nto the land of his adoption.  Had he stayed at home he would have done\\nmuch better work.\\n\\nThat Australia, however, will some day make amends by producing a poet of\\nher own we cannot doubt, and for him there will be new notes to sound and\\nnew wonders to tell of.\\n\\nThe best that we can say of him is that he wrote imperfectly in Australia\\nthose poems that in England he might have made perfect.\\n\\nJudges, like the criminal classes, have their lighter moments.\\n\\nThere seems to be some curious connection between piety and poor rhymes.\\n\\nThe South African poets, as a class, are rather behind the age.  They\\nseem to think that ‘Aurora’ is a very novel and delightful epithet for\\nthe dawn.  On the whole they depress us.\\n\\nThe only original thing in the volume is the description of Mr. Robert\\nBuchanan’s ‘grandeur of mind.’  This is decidedly new.\\n\\nDr. Cockle tells us that Müllner’s _Guilt_ and _The Ancestress_ of\\nGrillparzer are the masterpieces of German fate-tragedy.  His translation\\nof the first of these two masterpieces does not make us long for any\\nfurther acquaintance with the school.  Here is a specimen from the fourth\\nact of the fate-tragedy.\\n\\n                                 SCENE VIII.\\n\\n                      ELVIRA.                     HUGO.\\n\\n    ELVIRA (_after long silence_, _leaving the harp_, _steps to Hugo_,\\n    _and seeks his gaze_).\\n\\n    HUGO (_softly_).  Though I made sacrifice of thy sweet life, the\\n    Father has forgiven.  Can the wife—forgive?\\n\\n    ELVIRA (_on his breast_).  She can!\\n\\n    HUGO (_with all the warmth of love_).  Dear wife!\\n\\n    ELVIRA (_after a pause_, _in deep sorrow_).  Must it be so, beloved\\n    one?\\n\\n    HUGO (_sorry to have betrayed himself_).  What?\\n\\nThe Renaissance had for its object the development of great\\npersonalities.  The perfect freedom of the temperament in matters of art,\\nthe perfect freedom of the intellect in intellectual matters, the full\\ndevelopment of the individual, were the things it aimed at.  As we study\\nits history we find it full of great anarchies.  It solved no political\\nor social problems; it did not seek to solve them.  The ideal of the\\n‘Grand Siècle,’ and of Richelieu, in whom the forces of that great age\\nwere incarnate, was different.  The ideas of citizenship, of the building\\nup of a great nation, of the centralization of forces, of collective\\naction, of ethnic unity of purpose, came before the world.\\n\\nThe creation of a formal tradition upon classical lines is never without\\nits danger, and it is sad to find the provincial towns of France, once so\\nvaried and individual in artistic expression, writing to Paris for\\ndesigns and advice.  And yet, through Colbert’s great centralizing scheme\\nof State supervision and State aid, France was the one country in Europe,\\nand has remained the one country in Europe, where the arts are not\\ndivorced from industry.\\n\\nHawthorne re-created for us the America of the past with the incomparable\\ngrace of a very perfect artist, but Mr. Bret Harte’s emphasized modernity\\nhas, in its own sphere, won equal, or almost equal, triumphs.\\n\\nIt is pleasant to come across a heroine [Bret Harte’s _Cressy_] who is\\nnot identified with any great cause, and represents no important\\nprinciple, but is simply a wonderful nymph from American backwoods, who\\nhas in her something of Artemis, and not a little of Aphrodite.\\n\\nIt is always a pleasure to come across an American poet who is not\\nnational, and who tries to give expression to the literature that he\\nloves rather than to the land in which he lives.  The Muses care so\\nlittle for geography!\\n\\nBlue-books are generally dull reading, but Blue-books on Ireland have\\nalways been interesting.  They form the record of one of the great\\ntragedies of modern Europe.  In them England has written down her\\nindictment against herself and has given to the world the history of her\\nshame.  If in the last century she tried to govern Ireland with an\\ninsolence that was intensified by race hatred and religious prejudice,\\nshe has sought to rule her in this century with a stupidity that is\\naggravated by good intentions.\\n\\nLike most penmen he [Froude] overrates the power of the sword.  Where\\nEngland has had to struggle she has been wise.  Where physical strength\\nhas been on her side, as in Ireland, she has been made unwieldy by that\\nstrength.  Her own strong hands have blinded her.  She has had force but\\nno direction.\\n\\nThere are some who will welcome with delight the idea of solving the\\nIrish question by doing away with the Irish people.  There are others who\\nwill remember that Ireland has extended her boundaries, and that we have\\nnow to reckon with her not merely in the Old World but in the New.\\n\\nPlastic simplicity of outline may render for us the visible aspect of\\nlife; it is different when we come to deal with those secrets which\\nself-consciousness alone contains, and which self-consciousness itself\\ncan but half reveal.  Action takes place in the sunlight, but the soul\\nworks in the dark.  There is something curiously interesting in the\\nmarked tendency of modern poetry to become obscure.  Many critics,\\nwriting with their eyes fixed on the masterpieces of past literature,\\nhave ascribed this tendency to wilfulness and to affectation.  Its origin\\nis rather to be found in the complexity of the new problems, and in the\\nfact that self-consciousness is not yet adequate to explain the contents\\nof the Ego.  In Mr. Browning’s poems, as in life itself, which has\\nsuggested, or rather necessitated, the new method, thought seems to\\nproceed not on logical lines, but on lines of passion.  The unity of the\\nindividual is being expressed through its inconsistencies and its\\ncontradictions.  In a strange twilight man is seeking for himself, and\\nwhen he has found his own image, he cannot understand it.  Objective\\nforms of art, such as sculpture and the drama, sufficed one for the\\nperfect presentation of life; they can no longer so suffice.\\n\\nAs he is not a genius he, naturally, behaves admirably on every occasion.\\n\\nCertainly dialect is dramatic.  It is a vivid method of re-creating a\\npast that never existed.  It is something between ‘A Return to Nature’\\nand ‘A Return to the Glossary.’  It is so artificial that it is really\\nnaïve.  From the point of view of mere music, much may be said for it.\\nWonderful diminutives lend new notes of tenderness to the song.  There\\nare possibilities of fresh rhymes, and in search for a fresh rhyme poets\\nmay be excused if they wander from the broad highroad of classical\\nutterance into devious byways and less-trodden paths.  Sometimes one is\\ntempted to look on dialect as expressing simply the pathos of\\nprovincialisms, but there is more in it than mere mispronunciation.  With\\nthat revival of an antique form, often comes the revival of an antique\\nspirit.  Through limitations that are sometimes uncouth, and always\\nnarrow, comes Tragedy herself; and though she may stammer in her\\nutterance, and deck herself in cast-off weeds and trammelling raiment,\\nstill we must hold ourselves in readiness to accept her, so rare are her\\nvisits to us now, so rare her presence in an age that demands a happy\\nending from every play, and that sees in the theatre merely a source of\\namusement.\\n\\nThere is a great deal to be said in favour of reading a novel backwards.\\nThe last page is, as a rule, the most interesting, and when one begins\\nwith the catastrophe or the _dénoûment_ one feels on pleasant terms of\\nequality with the author.  It is like going behind the scenes of a\\ntheatre.

The face is ugly, and rather hatchet-shaped,\\nwith thick sensual lips, and is utterly unlike the poet himself, who was\\nvery beautiful to look upon.  ‘His countenance,’ says a lady who saw him\\nat one of Hazlitt’s lectures, ‘lives in my mind as one of singular beauty\\nand brightness; it had the expression as if he had been looking on some\\nglorious sight.’  And this is the idea which Severn’s picture of him\\ngives.  Even Haydon’s rough pen-and-ink sketch of him is better than this\\n‘marble libel,’ which I hope will soon be taken down.  I think the best\\nrepresentation of the poet would be a coloured bust, like that of the\\nyoung Rajah of Koolapoor at Florence, which is a lovely and lifelike work\\nof art.\\n\\n{5}  ‘Make’ is of course a mere printer’s error for ‘mock,’ and was\\nsubsequently corrected by Lord Houghton.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\npage at http://www.gutenberg.org/about/contact\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"
